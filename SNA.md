exaggerate my childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller-, (Puffing on his cigarette and nodding)(His head still down) The universe is expanding.The universe is expanding?(Heartily, looking down at Alvy) It won't be expanding for billions of years yet, Alvy. And we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here. Uh?, (Looking up at the doctor) Well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!(shouting) What is that your business?What's the point?, (To the doctor) He's been depressed. All off a sudden, he can't do anything.(Nodding) Why are you depressed, Alvy?(Nudging Alvy) Tell Dr. Flicker. (Young Alvy sits, his head down. His mother answers for him)(Excited, gesturing with her hands) What has the universe got to do with it? You're here in Brooklyn! Brooklyn is not expanding!, -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think. You know, I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some trouble between fantasy and reality. My father ran the bumper-car concession. (Alvy as a child moves into the frame driving a bumper car. He stops as other cars bombard him. His father continues to direct the traffic), I remember the staff at our public school. You know, we had a saying, uh, that "Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym." And ...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school. I must say- I always felt my schoolmates were idiots. Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time. And-and Ivan Ackerman, always the wrong answer. Always.(Still sitting in the back of the classroom)(Still standing next to the teacher) Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.Right. Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today., Even then I knew they were just jerks. (The camera moves back to the teacher, who is glaring out at her students)(Off screen) That's the second time this month! Step up here!What'd I do?Step up here!What'd I do?You should be ashamed of yourself.(First off screen, then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom)(The younger, Alvy standing next to her) Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.(Gesturing) Well, I never had a latency period. I can't help it.(With young, Alvy still at her side) Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? (The camera pans over to Donald, sitting up tall in his seat, then back to the teacher), I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian. They did not take me in the Army. I was, uh ... Interestingly enough, I was-I was four-P., Yes. In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a hostage., You always only saw the worst in people. You never could get along with anyone at school. You were always outta step with the world. Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world.', I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?, I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."You're crazy!No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."Alvy, you're a total paranoid.Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?Ah, Max, you, uh ...Stop calling me Max.Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this -so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.Right, Max. California, Max.Ah.Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.Forget it, Max.-we move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.(Checking his watch) Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?, (Overlapping the two men and stuttering)(Overlapping Alvy) Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!Okay. (They move into the ticket line, still talking. A billboard next to them reads "INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE TO FACE ,'LIV ULLMANN")Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!(Hitting his hand on the counter) That's it! Forget it! I-I can't go in.Two minutes, Alvy.(Overlapping Annie) No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We-we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.In the middle? (Alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh)You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.(Waving to Annie) Go ahead. Good-bye.Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?(Watching people with tickets move past them)Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie? (Annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks at her)Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.(Laughing now) H'h, that's a polite word for what you are., (Gesturing) A li-little louder. I think one of them may have missed it!, Hey!(Off screen) What?(Moving into the screen) Who's on television?(Also ignoring Alvy) What program?It's for my brudder.(To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) You really Alvy Singer, the ... the TV star?-Singer!, Hey, you on television?(Nodding his head) No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.What's your name?(Clearing his throat) You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-What's your name?(Nervously) I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.(Laughing) Come on.Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks very much ... for everything.This is Alvy Singer!Fellas ... you know-Jesus! Come on!(Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?(Overlapping 1st man) Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!(Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) This guy's on television.This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.(Holding out a matchbook) Can I have your autograph?You don't want my autograph.(Overlapping, Alvy's speech) Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.(Taking the matchbook and pen and writing), I need a large polo mallet!(Annoyed) Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the teamsters? You know.. .Alvy Singer over here!, (To McLuban) Tell him.(To the camera) Boy, if life were only like this!, (Overlapping the man's speech) I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.(To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking)I missed my therapy. I overslept.How can you possibly oversleep?The alarm clock.(Gasping) You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?I know-because of our sexual problem, right?(To Annie) I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.Stop it, Alvy!Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."Oh!I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?, (Overlapping Alvy and Annie) You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?(Sighing) He's screaming his opinions in my ear.Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly ... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-(Overlapping) Key word here is "indulgent."(Overlapping) -without getting ... well, let's put it this way ...Hey, you ... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?- It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't ... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.(Wringing his hands) Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.(Lighting a cigarette while he talks) Gal gun-shy is what it is.(Reacting again to the man in line) Probably on their first date, right?(Still going on) It's a narrow view.I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual ...(Even louder now) It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand? A hot medium ... as opposed to a ...(More and more aggravated) What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.... as opposed to a print ...(Sighing and addressing the audience) What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you? I mean, it's just maddening!Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And-and the funny part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!(Overlapping) Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of validity.Oh, do yuh?Yes.Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So ... so, here, just let me-I mean, all right. Come over here ... a second.Oh., (Reading) Well, stop listening to him.And then, the most important thing of all is a comedian's vision.And you know something else? You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you!, I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first., (Off screen) Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.(Off screen) You? You kiddin'? (He moves into the frame, lying across the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a face)That movie makes me feel guilty.Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.Alvy, I ...What-what-what-what's the matter?I-you know, I don't wanna.(Overlapping Annie, reacting) What-what-I don't ... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.I know, well, it's just that-you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.(Overlapping Annie again) It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What ... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly ... We're- we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.(Patting Alvy's band solicitously) I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.M'm., (Off screen, onstage) You know ...(Above the chatter around him) Look, what's your-what's your name?... a group from the ..., Oh, thank you., (Coughing) Thank you. I-I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the Eisenhower Administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years., (Coughing) Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?(Looking down at the clipboard) Who are you?Alvy ... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh ... you're on next.(Rubbing his hands together nervously)(Laughing) Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.(Gesturing) No, it can't be, because he's a comic.Yes.So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?Why not?No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't ... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.It's okay.No, because they're-they're laughing, so(Overlapping) Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.(Overlapping) I prefer not to, because ... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-(Overlapping) Yes.(Overlapping) -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?(Looking out at the stage) Allison.Yeah? Allison what?, (Off screen) Do you feel all right?(Off screen) ... General Eisenhower is not ...(Still looking off screen) Portchnik., (Looking down at the clipboard) Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... about twenty minutes, something like that., H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.Alvy.I'll tell you this! He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range. But ...We've been through this.If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.(Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette)Well, why not?Yeah, Earl Warren?(Moving toward the bed) Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.Lyndon Johnson?(Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing)Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?(Nodding his head) Tsch.The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room attendant.You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me., Oh, my God!, Alvy, now don't panic. Please.Look, I told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.Stop it! Don't ... don't do that! There.Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.Don't give it to me. Don't!(Hysterically) Oooh! Here! Here!(Pointing) Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. (They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him)(Laughing, to the lobster) Get him!(Laughing) Talk to him. You speak shellfish! (He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water)(Laughing) I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.(Overlapping) Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?(Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-(Overlapping Annie) Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!All right. All right. All right.Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?(Overlapping) Yeah. I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna get my camera.You know, I-I think ... if I could pry this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.Great! Great!All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!(Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier)Don't be a jerk. One more, Alvy, please, one more picture. (Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture), So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what ...Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.Well, then, w-who was?Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School., (Off screen) Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.(Off screen, laughing) Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.Then there was Jerry, the actor., It's like when I think of dying. You know how I would like to die?, Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ...Acting is like an exploration of the soul. I-it's very religious. Uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness. It's like a visual poem.Hey, that was last year.I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.Touch my heart ... with your foot., Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you like emotion too much., (Laughing) Is he kidding with that crap?, (Laughing) Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.I look pretty.(Incredulous, to Annie) You do?(Still watching) Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.I-I may throw up! CUT BACK TO:, He was creepy.Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.(Laughing) Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.Well, no ... not just, not only., Oh, I'd say so. You married-, There's Henry Drucker. He has a chair in history at Princeton. Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.Why are you so hostile?(Sighing) 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.(Squinting) Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."(Taking Robin's hand) I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.Commentary.Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery., (Off screen) -two of them., No jokes-these are friends, okay?, Here you are. There's people out there.Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now ...Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?(Looking at Robin) What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand ...Stop acting out.No, it'll be great! It'll be great, be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in there, you know, like ... discussing models of alienation and we'll be in here quietly humping.Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility."'Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?', (Pulling away again) There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?, Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers., Oh, I'm sorry!Don't get upset!Dammit! I was so close.(Gesturing) Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?(Reaching over for her eyeglasses on the night table)Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's ... You got crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-(Interrupting) Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can-we can start again.I can't.What-My head is throbbing.Oh, you got a headache!I have a headache.Bad?Oswald and ghosts.Jesus!Where are you going?, Max, my serve is gonna send yuh toRight, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.Max, the city is terribly worried.But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun., Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college ..., Hi.(Hitting the halt back) Holy gods!, I'm sorry. This is Annie Hall.(Laughing) I've had four lessons!, Oh, hi, Alvy.Hi.(Overlapping Alvy) Well ... so ...

Oh, God, whatta-(Still looking over his shoulder) Uh ... you-you wanna lift?(Turning and aiming her thumb over her shoulder)No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.(Laughing) Oh, no, I have a car.You have a car? (Annie smiles, hands folded in front of her)I don't ...(Zipping up his bag) Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?Me? Oh, downtown!Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.(Laughing) Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...(Laughing) So sorry.(Laughing) I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone., So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?(Laughing) Oh, I'm in her acting class.Oh - you're an actress.Well, I do commercials, sort of ...I, uh ... well, you're not from New York, right?No, Chippewa Falls.Right!Wisconsin.(Finally reacting) Uh, you're driving a-Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- (A car moves closer to the VW, almost on top of it in the wrong direction. Annie swerves away at the very last minute)No, no thanks. Hey, don't-Well, where is it? I-No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch the road. I'll get it-Okay.-for yuh.Okay, that's good.

Oh, my God! Look! There's a parking space!That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to the curb from here.Don't be funny.You want your tennis stuff?Huh? Oh ... yeah.You want your gear?

You-you're a wonderful tennis player.(Laughing) Oh.You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life . . . that's including any place ... the worst ... Europe, United ... any place ...

They have ... they have, uh ... a ... a quality.Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take a serious photography course soon.Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.Aesthetic criteria? You mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not?The-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. That's-Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know. I mean, I just try to uh, feel it, you know? I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective, I think.Well, I don't know.

Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy., Oh., M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.As Balzac said ...H'm?"There goes another novel."Oh, yeah?Yeah.Yeah?Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.No. (She turns and looks at Alvy, then laughs)Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play(Lighting a joint and laughing) You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.Good? I was-(Overlapping) No.No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.(Laughing) Here, you want some?No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party andYeah?-tried to take my pants off over myOh, I don't know, I don't really.

You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.M'hm.Those are the two categories ...M'hm.... you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?M'hm.And blind people, crippled ...Yeah.I don't-don't know how they get throughM'hm.You know, and the miserable is everyoneU-huh., Look, look at that guy.M'hm.There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?(Laughing) M'hm.

Italian, right?Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business(Laughing) Oh, yeah.No, I'm serious.Oh, yeah?(As another man walks by) And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest., You see, like you and I ...You are extremely sexy.No, I'm not.Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because ... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.Ooooh!You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps ... you get excited.Come on.You- Do you love me?Do I love you?That's the key question.Yeah.I know you've only known me a short while.Well, I certainly ...

How- Whose idea was it?Mine.Ye-ah. Was it ... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?(Looking up at Alvy) How is it any different?(Gesturing) It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. (Holding a book, he starts walking around the room)(Still sitting on the bed) That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.(Looking at Annie) That place is four hundred dollars a month?Yes, it is.(Whistling) It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.(Shaking her head) You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.Hey, don't be ridiculous.Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?(Putting his hand to his forehead) 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating., (Kissing and caressing Annie) Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?, (Reading) Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.What?No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for? (He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds)(Laughing) Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?(Yelling out to her as she leaves the room)(Off screen) Well, have you ever made love high?Me, no. You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.(Moving back into the room and lighting a joint)Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?(Closing the door) Well, what's the difference, anyway?Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. (She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana)Oh, come, you don't need that.What are you doing?(Kissing her) No, no, no, what ... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.M'm, wait, I got a great idea. (He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table)Uh-uh-why?I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.No, I'm fine.Really?U-huh.I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.Let's just do it, all right?(Reacting) You see, that's what I call removed.Oh, you have my body.Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.(Sighing) Well, I need grass and so do you.Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass(Overlapping) M'hm.(Overlapping) -so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.Were you always funny?, Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love., (Buttoning his jacket) Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good. Well, lemme explain a little bit o' how I work. You know, you can tell right off the bat that I don't look like a funny guy when I come-you know, like some o' the guys that come out. You know, right away(To himself) Jesus, this guy's pathetic.(Overlapping above speech) ... big lumberjack ...(To himself while the comic continues his routine)(Overlapping above speech) "'Cherie, come back. I love you., (Gesturing) W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to reorient myself. This is the University of Wisconsin, right? So I'm always ... I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a col- I've a very bad history with colleges.

But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.(Stopping for a moment) Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!(Catching up to her) Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.(Continuing to walk quickly) We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.(Still walking next to her) "Neat"!

You don't think I'm smart enough! We had that argument just last month, or don't ou remember that day?, (To Annie's back, gesturing) Why do you always bring that up? Because I encourage you to take adult-education courses? I think it's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors'., (Off screen) I'm home!(Turning) Oh, yeah? How'd it go?(Comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table)Yeah?And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.M'm.And then she mentioned penis envy ... Did you know about that?Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so ... you know.M'hm.G-go on, I'm interested.Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.M'hm.And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.Tsch.

So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?(Turning, ajar in her hand) Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.(Thinking) Tsch, what'd the doctor say?(Putting away some groceries) Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, Will it change my wife?Will it change your wife?Will it change my life?Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!No, I didn't.You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife. Will it change ...(Yelling out, angry) Life. I said, "life."(To the audience) She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.And, Alvy ... and then I told her about, I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon, Max, will you forget about Annie? I know lots of women you can date.I don't wanna go out with any other women., That's fine. That's fine. That's great! (Scratching his head) Love fades. God, that's a depressing thought.

It might have been Leopold and Loeb. (The telephone rings. Alvy picks it up, rising up slightly from the bed, concerned, as he talks), (Looking down at him) I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.(Sighing) Oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't be silly. You know,Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesqueOh, tsch, thank you.

But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.(Simultaneously, with Annie) You know ... it's getting expensive ...my analyst ... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress., (Simultaneously, with Alvy) Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman., (Laughing) Alvy, come on, for your own experience.

Right.Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace., This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?Trigger.Charlie Chaplin.Hey.Right before his un-American thing.Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers., All the good meetings are taken., (Laughing) I don't know. I don't know., Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings., Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies., (Looking back at Alvy) Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working., (Holding up a book) Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?(Walking into the room with an armload of books)(Reacting) Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.(Putting down the books and flipping back her hair)(Riffling through the books) There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.(Holding a framed picture and moving about)(Looking down at a book) This "Denial of Death". You remember this?Oh-This is the first book that I got you.-God.Remember that day?Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.Thanks, honey.(Patting Alvy's shoulder) Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you know?(Off screen) Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.(Off screen) Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.(Walking in with another armload of books)Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?What?(Holding a small box of buttons) We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause ... Right.(Overlapping) Exactly, but ... exactly. Ooooh!You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.(Taking a button from a box) Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-(Interrupting) Yeah.I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan., (Into the camera, to the audience) I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey.Oh, yeah? Well, if she is, then the hell with her! If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there! He's a jerk, for one thing.He graduated Harvard., Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makesYeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, lady? (He takes a small item from his pocket to show the woman)Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing., (Pointing to the lobster) This always happens to me. Quick, g-go get a broom.(Smoking) What are you making such a big deal about? (As she talks, the lobster drops from the tray to the floor. Alvy jumps away, then gingerly scrapes the tray toward the lobster)(Looking up in stooped-over position)(Still leaning against the sink, her hand on her hip)Sixteen years ago.(Puzzled) Whatta you mean?(Mocking) Mean?You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?, Listen, honey, Central Park's turning green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic that we-where we used to see ... with the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, and the roller skates? . . . Listen, I-I want you to come back here ... Well, I-I-then I'm gonna come out there and getcha., Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do- where do you think I am? I'm-I'm out ... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport. I flew in ..., Since you put it that way., (To the waitress) I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.Hi.You look very pretty.Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. (Alvy adjusts his glasses, not exactly knowing where to start; a bit uneasy)(Nodding his head) You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.(Adjusting her sunglasses) Oh, Alvy, come on.Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.(Looking around) Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and-and we play tennis. I mean, that's ... that's a very big step for me, you know? I mean ... (Reacting, Alvy looks down at his hands, then up)(Sadly) So whatta you ... You're not gonna come back to New York?(Smiling) What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.That's right, that's right.(Nodding his head and gesturing) That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.(Toying with his car keys) I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening.(Seriously) No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.(In disbelief) Okay.(Interrupting) You're mad, aren't you?(Shaking his head) No.Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know ... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh(Shrugging his shoulders) The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. I'm workin' on a play.(Nodding) No!You mean that ... (He gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables)I'm late.Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.The what?The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?Oh!I thought just earplugs.Just forget it, Alvy, okay? Let's just forget the conversation., (Yelling after her) Awards! They do nothing but give out awards! I can't believe it. Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler! (Getting out of the car) Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with-with-with-(Interrupting) May I see your license, please?Sure. (Searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket)Don't give me your life storyPick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-(Interrupting) Just give me the license, please., So long, fellas. Keep in touch., Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old., Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.(Carrying his jacket over his shoulder)(Starting the car) Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?(Reacting) You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.(Looking at Rob's helmet) Max, are we driving through plutonium?, You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.(In mirrored reflection) It's an important issue.(In mirrored reflection) Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life. You're like New York. You're an island.(Rising with emotion) Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here ... in a health -food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny., Wait! I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you.(To the audience, gesturing) Tsch, whatta you want? It was my first play. You know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life. Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

her.(off-screen) That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying, "As you wish," what he meant was, "I love you." (off-screen) And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.(off-screen) She went into her room and shut the door. And for days, she neither slept nor ate.(no emotion at all in her voice), Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.Farm Boy. Fill these with water --(pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself)I fear I'll never see you again.Of course you will.But what if something happens to you?Hear this now: I will come for you.But how can you be sure?, (off-screen groaning) I don't be-leeve this., (quietly, watching her) As you wish.As you wish.As you wish.This is true love. You think this happens every day?, -- wait, just wait ---- well, when does it get good?Keep your shirt on. Let me read. (off-screen reading) It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --(off-screen reading) Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --(off-screen, perking up a little), We're back in the boat. Those are the Shrieking Eels., Whoever he is, he's too late --, Then there will be no one to hear you scream-What is that you're ripping?(whirling on Fezzik) Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.I agree with Fezzik.(We only thought he was in a fury --now he's really getting mad) (to Inigo) -- when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy -- (now to Fezzik, who retreats as much as he can while Vizzini advances)(whirling on them) Enough of that.(to Inigo) We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn. Why are you doing that?Making sure nobody's following us.Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own. Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-You're sure nobody's following us?As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.What? (explaining with as much logic as he can muster) Go in, get after her!Put her down. Just put her down.pointing behind them. I think he's getting closer.Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using., (off-screen) Buttercup's emptiness consumed her. Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride, she did not love him. (off-screen) Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride.Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels -- if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh. If you swim back now, I promise, no harm will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels.(reading) "Do you know what that sound is, Highness?"(off-screen) All right, all right, let's see. Uh, she was in the water, the Eel was coming after her. She was frightened. The Eel started to charge her. And then -, (off-screen reading) Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to be.(raises his hands, starts to speak) My people ... the Princess Buttercup!!, (off-screen) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time.What?The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.Well, I wasn't nervous. Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.Because I can stop now if you want.No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want.(off-screen) We're past that, Grandpa. You read it already., (softly) That Vizzini, he can fuss. (a slight emphasis on the last word)(looking at Inigo) ... fuss ... fuss ... (Suddenly, he's got it again, emphasis on the last word.)Probably he means no harm.He's really very short on charm.(proudly) Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?I don't swim., We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village nearby?There is nothing nearby; not for miles.That would be inconceivable.Despite what you think, you will be caught. And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged.Veer left. Left. Left!still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.He's no concern of ours. Sail on!, (staring deep at him) Only compared to some., Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.treading water., (not stopping or turning) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.Who's Guilder?(pointing straight out) The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.You never said anything about killing anyone.I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.Yes, some of the time.If there are, we'll all be dead.No more rhymes now, I mean it.Anybody want a peanut?(to the unasked question) I only dog paddle., (off-screen) Oh no. No, please.What is it? What's the matter?They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?Someday, you may not mind so much.Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good., There will never be a need., I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either -- Please understand, I hold you in the highest respect.So, it is down to you. And it is down to me. If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward.Let me explain--- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.There will be no arrangement --But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.You're that smart?Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?Yes.Morons.Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.For the Princess? To the death? I accept.Good. Then pour the wine. Inhale this, but do not touch.(doing it) I smell nothing.(taking the packet back) What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.Hmm. watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead.But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.(And now there's a trace of nervousness beginning)Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.Wait till I get going! Where was I?Australia.Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.(very nervous) You're just stalling now.(cackling) You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --(triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.(fool's courage) Then make your choice.I will. And I choose -- -- what in the world can that be?What? Where? I don't see anything.busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.What's so funny?I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.You guessed wrong., staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand.Come, sir. We must get you to your ship.We are men of action. Lies do not become us.Well spoken, sir -- -- what is it?, He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around. walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what it is. (hollering down) Hello there. Slow going?Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.Sorry.Thank you.I do not suppose you could speed things up?(with some beat) If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.That does put a damper on our relationship.But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.No good. I've known too many Spaniards.You don't know any way you'll trust me?Nothing comes to mind.I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.Throw me the rope.He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over -- straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and -- watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo.(pulling his sword) Thank you.We'll wait until you're ready.Again. Thank you.I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?Do you always begin conversations this way?My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.(fondling it-impressed) I have never seen its equal.The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel ... I failed ... the six-fingered man did leave me alive with the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these.How old were you?I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."You've done nothing but study swordplay?More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.(handing back the great sword, starting to rise)You are ready, then?Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.(walking away a few paces, unsheathing his sword)Begin! (thrilled) You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah?I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.(coping as best he can) -- naturally --Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa- -- which I have. And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. (happy as a clam) You are wonderful!Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.I admit it -- you are better than I am.Then why are you smiling?Because I know something you don't know.And what is that?I am not left-handed. and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.You're amazing!I ought to be after twenty years.(hollering it out) There's something I ought to tell you.Tell me.I am not left-handed either.And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. staring in awe. Who are you?!No one of consequence.I must know.Get used to disappointment.Okay. moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes, darts back, all in almost a single movement and -- And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember, and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with the sixfingered sword. catching it again. And something terrible is written behind his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do, tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose. Kill me quickly., Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ... that other thing. Move it!hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like papooses. (looking down) He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.stunned, turning to the others, looking down. He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!(whirling on Vizzini) You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess, and must therefore die.I want to duel him left-handed.You know what a hurry we're in.Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.(calling out) I'm waiting!, I don't envy you the headache you will have when you awake. But, in the meantime, rest well ... and dream of large women.They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.Someone has beaten a giant!That was a warning, Highness. The next time, my hand flies on its own. For where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies., (vaulting onto his horse) I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive., There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.Who won? How did it end?(looking down in the position where Inigo fell unconscious)Shall we track them both?The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --Could this be a trap?I swear it will be done. (whispering) Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp., Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you., Now, was that so terrible?Surrender!You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.I tell you once again -- surrender!(roaring) For the last time -- SURRENDER!whirling to face her. What was that?, (little frown; softly) My way's not very sportsmanlike. He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly. I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.I believe you -- So what happens now?We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?(gently) I could kill you now.Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise.Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed. as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. You're quick.And a good thing too.(getting set for another onslaught)Oh no. It's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.(standing, talking as he does so) as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.(his arms never leave Fezzik's throat)(his voice just beginning to get a little strained)Why should that make such a difference?Well ... (And now his voice is definitely growing weaker) and there isn't much breath coming. as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands., Inconceivable! (shrieking) Faster!I thought I was going faster.You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.(cutting through) -- I do not accept excuses.(hurt) Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.Did I make it clear that your job is at stake? cutting through the last of the rope and CUT TO:standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge. (to Inigo -- impressed) He has very good arms.(turns abruptly, starts off-screen)who goes to Inigo. You be careful.Inconceivable! Give her to me. (grabs Buttercup starts off)(starting to panic) What do I do?Finish him, finish him. Your way.Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, and in a few minutes, the Man in Black will come running around the bend. The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!, Who are you?I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.(a final glance back toward Vizzini)(his voice harsh now, carrying the promise of violence)If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find youYou think your dearest love will save you?I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.You admit to me you do not love your fiance?He knows I do not love him."Are not capable of love" is what you mean.I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.Rest, Highness.(stares at him) I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.(bowing) With pride. What can I do for you?You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?You killed my love.It's possible; I kill a lot of people. Who was this love of yours? Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby?No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm. And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears. On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.(explaining as a teacher might)You mock my pain!Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? Does it bother you to hear?Nothing you can say will upset me.He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.And what am I?Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day! and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has. You can die too, for all I care!! staring transfixed at what she has wrought.... as ... you ... wish..., bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.Can you move at all?(weakly stretching out an arm toward him)I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?Well ... you were dead.Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.I will never doubt again.WESTLEY Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying. We'll never survive.Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. It's not that bad. I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before. Well now, that was an adventure. Singed a bit, were you?(She wasn't and she shakes her head "no")Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes. (happily) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. You see, what I told you before about saying "please" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty. Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.What? -- go on --Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. "I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts," he said. "My name is Ryan. I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia." Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley. So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you?placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and CUT TO: We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.No. No. We have already succeeded. I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...screaming and -- Westley!jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now, sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder. with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound -- with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is trying to put itself out.relieved. (almost in disbelief) We did it.It will not happen!(roaring right back, bigger) DEATH FIRST!!whirling to face her. What was that?I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you., (roaring with laughter) You only think I guessed wrong -- watching him. You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is "Never get involved in a land war in Asia." But only slightly less well known is this: "Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.", (almost a smile) I swear it will be done., Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?Disappeared. He must have seen us closing in, which might account for his panicking in error. Unless I'm wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire swamp.looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we -- looking the other way --frantically staring around, and now CUT TO: Will you promise not to hurt him?talking to them both. If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.(looks at Westley) He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor: CUT TO:, You have six fingers on your right hand -- someone was looking for you -- Where am I?(he only whispers) The Pit of Despair. (garbled) Don't even think -- (A hack, sputter, cough - now his voice seems normal again)Then I'm here till I die?(working away) Till they kill you. Yeah.Then why bother curing me?The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.So it's to be torture. I can cope with torture. You don't believe me?, You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave..., (unbelieving) Of course., Get some rest -- if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything. Beautiful, isn't it? It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present I'm writing the definitive work on the subject. So I want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel. This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting.He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself CUT TO: and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as we finally CUT TO:As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Well, really, that's all this is. Except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel?in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries., My father's final words were..., in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway. Yellin.(bows, then kneels) Sire.As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.Of course. She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.It won't be easy, Sire., (off-screen) -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa. You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!Do you want me to go on with this?Yes.(off-screen, still reading) It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.(off-screen) See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?, I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.Yes.I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. (Finding the knot on the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing a staircase leading underground.)Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped.Interesting., My spy network has heard no such news., My father's final words were "love her as I loved her, and there will be joy." I present to you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands nearby. It comes to this: I love Westley. I always have. I know now I always will. If you tell me I must marry you in ten days, please believe I will be dead by morning.Then we will simply alert him.My Westley will always come for me.entering. Any word from Westley?Too soon, my angel. Patience.He will come for me., coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.(off-screen) -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up., touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we CUT TO: Why do you do this?Because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up.(distraught) But they would have killed Westley if I hadn't done it.Your true love lives and you marry another --, (off-screen) The King died that very night, and before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were married. (off-screen) And at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.All right, then. No more interruptions.(alone, exhausted) Try ruling the world sometime., jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct. IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU! (at Westley) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will., (sharpening his dagger) Rise and report.The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.Double it. My Princess must be safe.The gate has but one key, and I carry that.Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four., (clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam..., I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all.(opening a small window in the door)Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?(looking at the Giant) You are the Brute Squad.We need a miracle. It's very important.Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.He's already dead.(for the first time, interested) He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in. I've seen worse.Sir. Sir.Hah?We're really in a terrible rush.(He takes nothing from nobody) Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?Sixty-five.Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause.This is noble, sir.Are you a rotten liar.I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.Your first story was better.(stupefied) He's dead. He can't talk.Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth. Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.What's that?True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.(to Valerie) Shut up --Humiliations galore!That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.A good hour. Yeah.(heading out the door, Fezzik close behind), Not to fifty!!!, Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!-- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.(a little appalled) That's a miracle pill?, Well, you give him some trouble. Move!keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --, (barely able to speak) It just is not fair., Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated, -- get back, witch --I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.You never had it so good."True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --(retreating) Don't say another word, Valerie.(turning to Inigo and Fezzik) He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --(pursuing him now) What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck(holding his hands over his ears)A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --Nobody's hearing nothing!Humperdinck. Humperdinck --(finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?An hour.Yeah, an hour.Okay.(waving after them) Bye-bye, boys.Have fun storming the castle.(to Max) Think it'll work?It would take a miracle. Bye!, Go through his clothes and look for loose change. (to Westley) Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's so important? What you got here that's worth living for?, (he is possessed by demons now) (big) There will be blood tonight!!, He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange. Father, I have failed you for twenty years. Now our misery can end. Somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my sword. Please. Guide my sword. walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.... tr ... oooo .... luv...Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Your guess is as good as mine --We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --Let me explain -- Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.I've always been a quick healer.There is but one working castle gate. And it is guarded by sixty men.And our assets?Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.All right, all right. Come on, help me up. Now, I'll need a sword eventually.Why? You can't even lift one.True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? (And his bead tilts limply back. Fezzik sets it up right for him)Now?Now?, (off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean, "He's dead?" I mean he didn't mean dead. Westley's only faking, right?You want me to read this or not?Who gets Humperdinck?I don't understand.Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for?You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop now.(shaking his head) No! I'm okay. I'm okay., I hope we win..., (off-screen) FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited. And as FEZZIK nursed his inebriated friend back to health, he told Inigo of Vizzini's death and the existence of Count Rugen, the sixfingered man. Considering Inigo's lifelong search, he handled the news surprisingly well. (off-screen) Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo.Okay. (sitting and opening the book again), (off-screen) The day of the wedding arrived. The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's orders., drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry. I am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to go back to the beginning. So I have. This is where I am, and this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved.Ho there.I do not budge. Keep your "Ho there."But the Prince gave orders ---- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it's the beginning, and I'm staying till Vizzini comes.(gesturing off-screen) You! Brute! Come here., Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. Every ship but the four you sent.staring at Humperdinck. You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.(sharply) You're a silly girl.Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.(close to erupting; speaks very distinctly)Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.You don't seem excited, my little muffin.Should I be?Brides often are, I'm told., (gently, confidently) I do not marry tonight. and she couldn't seem more serene. My Westley will save me., (bows, exits) Your Majesties., Yeah?, (to an unpleasantlooking assistant)Almost. There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble., -- I -- am -- waiting -- for -- Vizzini --Hello.It's you.True! You don't look so good. (after Inigo blasts air in protest)Perhaps not. I feel fine.(up and going) That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so I may kill him?He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.How many could you handle?I don't think more than ten.(doing the math on his fingers) That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.But Vizzini's dead.No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black ---- what? ---- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go ---- where?To find the Man in Black, obviously.But you don't know where he is.(instantly) FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.The Man in Black?His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? -- pardon me, it's important -- -- Fezzik, please --(gigantic and roaring) Everybody ... MOVE!!Thank you. Where is the Man in Black? You get there from this grove, yes? Fezzik, jog his memory.(upset) I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard. Inigo?He's dead.Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.The body?(not stopping) Have you any money?I have a little.Inigo -- there's more than thirty --(absolutely unfazed) What's the difference? (indicating the half- dead Westley)Has it been fifteen minutes?We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.(following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?You've been mostly dead all day.Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?There we cannot help you.(pulling one out) Will this do?(to Fezzik-- surprised) Where did you get that?I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --(sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.(nods) Right, right, sorry.Inigo.What?(deep and booming) I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS. THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS. and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley., The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed! (opening the window) Beat it or I'll call the Brute Squad.I'm on the Brute Squad., Bye., dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.(frantic) I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.Guess not very long.Why won't my arms move?That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.You've just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.absolutely stunned. That's it? Impossible. If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this...(trying to be cheery) You just shook your head -- that doesn't make you happy?Over the Albino, I think.At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.Not yet.Light him., (roaring) THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST, (off-screen) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground. Stand your ground.MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE, BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE, ... so tweasuwe your vruv..Skip to the end.And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...Man and wife -- say man and wife...Man and wife., Because he has no strength --and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds. I knew it! I knew you were bluffing! I knew he was bluffing., FEZZIK, the portcullis.Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do itentering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword. A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.No.(about to charge, stops short)I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first. It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose.gripping his sword, watching. -- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --(takes step forward) -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with itWrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.-- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing?" will echo in your perfect ears. That is what "to the pain" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. I think you're bluffing --lying there, staring at him. It's possible, pig -- I might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps I have the strength after all.staring, eyes wide., as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild panic -- Stay where you are. I said stay where you are!Oh, you mean this gate key., Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning.behind him, coming like a streak and -- closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and -- trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ... I tried...Good heavens. Are you still trying to win? You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble some day.And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. slowly pushing away from the wall. (all but audible) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die. pushing slowly off from the wall again. (a little louder) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die. (a little louder still) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.Stop saying that!(all he's got) HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA. YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO DIE.No ---- offer me money ---- yes ---- power too -- promise me that ---- all that I have and more please ---- offer me everything I ask for ---- anything you want --(roaring) I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH! and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and --lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear., And now he is standing, sword in fighting position. (slow and determined) DROP-YOUR-SWORD. (to Humperdinck) Have a seat. speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits. Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like.entering, looking around. Where's Fezzik?I thought he was with you.No.In that case --(staring at the Prince) Shall I dispatch him for you?You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life., (every ounce of honesty he's got), (off-screen) They rode to freedom. And as dawn arose, Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe. A wave of love swept over them. And as they reached for each other...What? What?No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.I don't mind so much.Okay. (off-screen) Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind. The end. Now I think you ought to go to sleep.Okay.(standing, readying to leave) Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long.Grandpa? Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.(a beat) As you wish..., (can hardly be understood) Strange wedding.Yes. A very strange wedding. Come along., still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles INIGO Thank you --(smiling away --his hearing isn't what it once was), (as Inigo gets him ready for his jump), standing there. Dazed. He didn't come.You must be that little Spanish brat I taught a lesson to all those years ago. It's simply incredible. Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now? I think that's the worst thing I ever heard. How marvelous., (considers this, then) Thank you, but no -- whatever happens to us, I want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice., Fezzik, tear his arms off.(to Rugen, evenly and soft) Hello.

FEZZIK!(to Westley) I'll be right back.(off-screen) Inigo! Inigo, where are you? leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on the balcony. Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw the Prince's stables, and there they were, four white horses. And I thought, there are four of us, if we ever find the lad -- hello, lad -- so I took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other.FEZZIK, you did something right.Don't worry -- I won't let it go to my head., ...

She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move.Oh, Westley, darling.(gently) Gently.At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?What hideous sin have you committed lately?I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.It never happened.What?It never happened.But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."Did you say, "I do"?Well, no, we sort of skipped that part., What was that for?Because you've always been so kind to me. And I won't be seeing you again since I'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Suite., staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on Inigo smiling, then --(to Buttercup) Help him.Why does Westley need helping?, Have you the wing?, Your Westley is dead.

This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover. So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. Can you like of Paris' love?I'll look to like, if looking liking move, But no more deep will I endart mine eye, Than your consent gives strength to make it fly., Every man betake him to his legs!True, I talk of dreams; Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.

Being but heavy, I will bear the light.Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.Too great oppression for a tender thing.Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Come, we burn daylight, ho!But 'tis no wit to go.Why, may one ask?I dreamt a dream tonight.And so did I.Well, what was yours?That dreamers often lie.In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage. This is she, this is she...Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.

Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror. He turns: The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank. Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers., Juliet, your mother calls., Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight. For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night., What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my, (whispering to Juliet) A man, young lady, such a man., He shall be endured! You'll make a mutiny among my guests! What? Cheerly my hearts! You'll not endure him! Am I the master here or you? Go to., Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so?Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A Montague, our foe.Young Romeo is it?'Tis he.Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him.I'll not endure him., To strike him dead I hold it not a sin., Will you now deny to dance?, You kiss by th' book., If I profane with my unworthiestGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that pilgrim's hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?(a gentle scolding) Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake.Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged.Then have my lips the sin that they have took.Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.Ay so I fear, The more is my unrest., His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy., Away, begone, the sport is at its best., Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come, let's away.(under his breath) Is she a Capulet?, My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me, I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall., "I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh...", Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out., Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!, He ran this way. Call, good Mercutio., Nay, I'll conjure too. Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us!, He jests at scars that never felt a wound., O Romeo, that she were, O that she, Come, shall we go?, Cast it off! It is my lady. O, it is my love! O that she knew she were!Ay me!(WHISPERS) She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel!O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.I take thee at thy word! Call me but love, and I'll be new baptised. Henceforth I never will be Romeo., But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with, So thrive my soul., What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful toArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art.(with splashy bravado) With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.(a real fear) If they do see thee, they will murder thee.I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by theirThou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops -O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.What shall I swear by?Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.If my heart's dear love -Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, tooO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.I gave thee mind before thou didst request it! And yet I would it were to give again.Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose love?(to Nurse) By and by I come! To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send.A thousand times good night!A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?By the hour of nine.I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then. Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow., Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast, Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest., But to be frank and give it thee again.Juliet!(BREATHLESSLY) Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable. Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.Madam!I come, anon - But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee...Madam!Madam!, Within the infant rind of this weak, O mickle is the powerful grace thatIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities., (to the boys) For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. For naught so vile on the earth doth live, But to the earth some special good doth give; Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use, Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. Two such opposed kings encamp them, Good morrow, father!, Good morrow, father!, Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young son, it argues a distempered, The last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.(he stops) God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. I have forgot that name and that name's woe.That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me. That's by me wounded. Both our(buttoning a long black cassock) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou consent to marry us today.Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.(very angry) For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I'll thy assistant be. For this alliance may so happyO, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste., O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell., Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast., Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?(slamming down the phone) Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so that he will sure run mad.(running to keep up) Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.(halts abruptly) A challenge, on my life.Romeo will answer it?Any man that can write may answer a letter.Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! Stabbed with a white wench's black eye, Run through the ear with a love song.(struggling to break free) Why, what is Tybalt?(releasing him) More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the courageous captain of compliments. The very butcher of a silk button. A duellist, a duellist.Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!, Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.(SARCASTICALLY) A most courteous exposition.Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.(CAMPLY) Pink for flower?I will bite thee on the ear for that jest!Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry a match., Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou..., (BEMUSED) God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.I desire some confidence with you.Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell., A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!She will endite him to some supper?, (QUIETLY) What thou art, by art as well as by nature.Here's goodly gear.(taken by surprise) Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.(as he closes the door) I will follow you., If ye should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing., Bid her to come to confession this afternoon, And there she shall at Friar Laurence's cell Be shrived and, O God she comes!, Then hie you hence to Father Laurence cell. There stays a husband to make you a wife!, O honey nurse, what news? Nurse!I am aweary, give me leave awhile. Fie, how my bones ache. What a jaunce have I.I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news. Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay awhile? Can you not see I am out of breath?How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath! Is the news good or bad? Answer to that.Well, you have made a simple choice. You know not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.

And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee!'

I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I., I never injured thee, And so, good Capulet, which name I, O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!, Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance.Either withdraw unto some private place. Or reason coldly of your grievances.

Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live!, Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last. Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill., Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.

Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours wife have mangled it? But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then? Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death: I would forget it fain - exiled. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled. To speak that word is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain, All dead. Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed, And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead., Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

1104_049, 1104_069, (heavy Russian accent) We are here., Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen., Do you see it? I don't see it... there!It still gets me every time.Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead., Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here. It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above.You are so full of shit, boss.Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. Right. Let's go to work.Walkin' the dog. I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.I'm tryin' boss. I'm crossing the bedroom.Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door. Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?Oh baby baby baby., Who's the best? Say it.Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be. Shit.You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered., You are, Lewis.(to the video cameraman) Get that outta my face., You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.The partners want to know how it's going?, How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?! Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck... I'll be God damned.Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks., I'll be God damned., I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering some amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and educational value., I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing just that.Turn that up please, dear.Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found today... ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?, There's a satellite call for you.Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water?No, trust me, you want to take this call., Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me., This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ?Rose Calvert.I told you you wanted to take this call., I was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr., ... Mrs. Calvert?(to Rose) Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?, She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe.They're inbound., She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.A hundred and one next month.Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say., S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends., Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck?, Is your stateroom alright?Oh, yes. There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.Would you like anything?I should like to see my drawing., It was a dreadful, heavy thing.You actually believe this is you, grandma?, Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.April 14, 1912., Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too...It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number?I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost?Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. (to Rose) And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.(indicating the drawing) You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value.Deal.This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it. The reflection has changed a bit. My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss., Are you ready to go back to Titanic?, I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away.(skeptical) You don't want anything?, Live from 12,000 feet. The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here. We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here..., No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up... The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM! The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk., Will you share it with us?, (taking the wheelchair) I'm taking her to rest., Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical.No!Tell us, Rose.It's been 84 years...Just tell us what you can--, (holds up her hand for silence) It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was..., Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir., It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains. Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming., You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths. Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.(gazing at the leviathan) So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family., It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way--I put my faith in you, good sir. (curtly, indicating Lovejoy) See my man., I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.You told me to change.I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.I felt like black., Steady!!Sorry squire!, (to the porter) These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms., We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great., Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution., (jaunty) Hit me again, Sven. The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh...What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo--Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... (grinning) 'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!(to the Swedes) Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and... Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!! (to pubkeeper) Capito?? I go to America!!, Shit!! Come on, Fabri!, (grabbing Fabrizio's arm) Come on, Sven. We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!, Wait!! We're passengers!Have you been through the inspection queue?(lying cheerfully) Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans., Gundersen. And..., (testy) Right, come aboard., Goodbye! I will never forget you!!, You know somebody?Of course not. That's not the point., (in Swedish/ subtitled) Where is Sven?, (coming into the sitting room) He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. Put that in the wardrobe.It smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... just to think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first--(looking at Rose) And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first.(blushing at the innuendo) S'cuse me, Miss., The first and only. Forever., Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.(looking at a cubist portrait) You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again... ?, At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called "new money". By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean..., Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of the way if you think you can manage., Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs., All ahead full!, I can see the Statue of Liberty already., She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch., Twenty one knots, sir!, She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history..., (tense but feigning unconcern) Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on., Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.My God, Rose, what's gotten into--Excuse me., Why're ships always bein' called "she"? Is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?(mortified) I do apologize., Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability, luxury... and safety--, So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?, You know I don't like that, Rose., She knows. (to the waiter) We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce.She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?, (disliking the attention) Well, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is..., ...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keel plates up., That's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit.That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things., Like we could forget. Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next to the likes o' her., I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed., Here, what's all this?! (to Jack) Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch!, Don't do it.Stay back! Don't come any closer!Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.No you won't.What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.You're distracting me. Go away.I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.I'm a good swimmer.The fall alone would kill you.It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.How cold?(taking off his left shoe) Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. Ever been to Wisconsin?(perplexed) No.Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the--I know what ice fishing is!Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.You're crazy.That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.Alright.I'm Jack Dawson.(voice quavering) Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. HELP! HELP!!, I've got you. I won't let go., (shaking his head) Women and machinery do not mix., Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do? I know.(looking straight at Rose) Sure. Count me in.Good. Settled then. This should be amusing., (as Lovejoy passes) Can I bum a cigarette?, Uh huh. That was pretty much it., You wanted to see the propellers?(rubbing her arms) Let's get you in. You're freezing.(low) Ah... perhaps a little something for the boy?, You'll want to tie those., Well! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done!, What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!Cal, stop! It was an accident.An accident?!It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?, It's for royalty. And we are royalty. There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you would deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose., (unexpectedly tender) I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why. I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...My God... Cal. Is it a--Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats. It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the--The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming., Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a heart of ice., Well, that's the general idea, my dear.So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?(warningly) Lewis...(still laughing) All you had to do was wait two days!, That's enough., Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?, I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett., After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar., Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there., Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.(looks at him hard) You think she was really there?, The partners are pissed.Bobby, buy me time. I need time.We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to pull., Well you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.Don't you mean work me?Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and (MORE) one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.(with undisguised desperation) Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.What?That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand?, The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt., As if I hadn't felt the sun in years., No Italian? Some little English?, No, no. Norwegian. Only., Uh, yes. Of course. After you., Hello Jack.Hello again.Could I speak to you in private?, So, you got a name by the way?Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.Mr. Dawson, I--Jack.Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.Well, here you are.Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.You're welcome. Rose.Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.(she lowers her head) Oh God, I am such an utter fool.That penguin last night, is he one of them?Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.Is he your boyfriend?Worse I'm afraid.Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom. So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.Yes, exactly!So don't marry him.If only it were that simple.It is that simple.Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.Well, I guess I will tonight.What's this?Just some sketches.May I? Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.(laughing) You're deranged! Well, well... (trying to be very adult) And these were drawn from life?Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.You liked this woman. You used her several times.She had beautiful hands.(smiling) I think you must have had a love affair with her...(laughing) No, no! Just with her hands.(looking up from the drawings) You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.I see you.And...?, You wouldn'ta jumped., Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before she sits with us.Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take the air on the boat deck., So you've not lit the last four boilers then?No, but we're making excellent time.(impatiently) Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines!I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in., Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all., That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip., (girlish and excited) You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!(laughing) You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.(angry in a flash) Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.I'm sorry. Really... I am., Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... ...or a moving picture actress!You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling., Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.Shall we go dress, mother?, (as they walk away) Rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. Honestly!, Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot-- Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?, Charmed, I'm sure., Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What are you planning to wear? I figured., So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.A whole ten cents?!(not getting it) Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.(looks at the dusk sky) Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?Sure. If you like.(smiling at him) I think I would.They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely. Your turn. Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!... That was great!, Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?Not really., The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly., Good evening, sir., Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damn things after 20 years. There you go. I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's been eating while I'm away. My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny., (caught off guard) Dawson! I didn't recognize you., Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson., I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it., Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club., There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs., How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch., J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson., Thank you., Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up., Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck., Hockley, she is splendid., No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually., He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon..., (low, to Jack) Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.(rising) Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?(low) Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe., To making it count., Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good on this ship.(to the waiter) No caviar for me, thanks.And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor.You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?How is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson?, Jack, must you go?, Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count., Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin., Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this little book.His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews., I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?, He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas?All three million of them., Well said, Jack., A real man makes his own luck, Archie.Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing., The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.(answering for him) Just a soupcon of lemon...No thanks. I'm heading back., Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night.(low to Madame Aubert) What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here?, All life is a game of luck., Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.Thankyou, Rose., (raising his glass) Here, here., Want to go to a real party?, May I cut in, miss?You're still my best girl, Cora.I don't know the steps.Just move with me. Don't think.Wait... stop!, How you two doin'?, I don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine., Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse?, You stupid bastard!!, So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. Oooowww! I haven't done that in years., You think a first class girl can't drink?, Rose!!, Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.A mistake?Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.(laughing) I did, didn't I? (pointing suddenly) Look! A shooting star.That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?What would you wish for?Something I can't have., We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy., I had hoped you would come to me last night.I was tired.Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.(stiffening) I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee--Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?, You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it!Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.(wheeling on her) Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.(hurt and lost) How can you put this on my shoulders?Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?It's so unfair., Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy., (singing) O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea., I was just here last night... don't you remember?Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--I don't want money, I----and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate.I just need to talk to Rose for a--, Look, you, you're not supposed to be in here., Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs., Yes sir!, Don't be absurd. I can't think of a skill I should likely need less., The next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please., Reminds me of my Harvard days., She's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. But she's in another world, Jackie, forget her. She's closed the door.It was them, not her., He's not bein' logical, I tell ya., Amore is'a not logical., Another ice warning, sir. This one from the "Baltic"., Did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts?, Haven't seen them since Southampton., Thankyou, Sparks. Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit., About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.(slapping the side of a boat) Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship!, Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true., Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and--Jack, I--No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.It's not up to you to save me, Jack.You're right. Only you can do that., I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone., Oh, look what I've done., Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been..., Wish I had those bleedin' binoculars., Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. Fabrizio said you might be up--Sssshh. Come here. Close your eyes. Okay. Open them.I'm flying!, (singing softly) Come Josephine in my flying machine..., So we're up to dusk on the night of the sinking. Six hours to go.Don't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand..., That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he knows is wrong., (sweating) He does landscapes., Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?(bad French accent) Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny.Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.Should I be expecting him anytime soon?Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.What is it? A sapphire?A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. Tell me when it looks right to you.Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it.I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing., My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of my life... up till then at least.What, uh... happened next?, (smiling) You mean, did we "do it"?, Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night., Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine., (low but forceful) This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her., None of the stewards have seen her., And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful., I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.Yes sir., Miss Rose? Hello?, Come on! Take us down. Quickly, quickly!, Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh! After you, m'lady., Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble..., (shouting over the din) Carry on! Don't mind us!, We're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make it into New York Tuesday night!, Au contraire, mon cher. Put your hands on me Jack., Where to, Miss?To the stars.Are you nervous?, Look at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da., Christ! It's that idiot on the Californian., "No seasickness. Poker business good. Al". Well that's it for me. I'm shutting down., Stupid bastard. I try to warn him about the ice, and he says "Keep out., You're trembling., It's okay. I'm alright. I can feel your heart beating., Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such fine hands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remember their touch even now., Well I can., You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.Bollocks., I have a better idea., Got yer!, Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same. Bugger me!! Pick up, ya bastard., Cor... look at that, would ya.They're a bloody sight warmer than we are., I know. It doesn't make any sense.

What do you see?Iceberg right ahead!, Hey, can I get some ice here, please?, Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!!Hard a 'port!, (standing behind Hitchins) Hard'a starboard. The helm is hard over, sir., Go Lads! Go! Go!, Full astern! FULL ASTERN!!, Oy, mate... that was a close shave., Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship., (stiffly, to Moody) Note the time. Enter it in the log.What was that, Mr. Murdoch?An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and I--Close the emergency doors.The doors are closed., Ma-- che cazzo!, Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder?, Looks okay. I don't see anything.Could it have damaged the ship?, It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay., If this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me., Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now you moron!, There's no cause for alarm. Please, go back to your rooms. Please, sir. There's no emergency--, (glaring) Excuse me., She's making water fast... in the forepeak tank and the forward holds, in boiler room six., A five degree list in less than ten minutes., Why have we stopped?We've struck ice.Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?, That's it, lads.

Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...That's it.(just to her, low and cold) Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on., Is this it?, Something serious has happened.(uncertain) He couldn't have.Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe.But I was with him the whole time., Why do women believe men?, When can we get underway, do you think?The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.But this ship can't sink!, Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.That's right.Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.The pumps--She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will.

Is this in any way unclear?(after a long beat) What do I tell your mother?Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.You're precious to me, Rose., Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read.Dawson. Rose Dawson., We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all., No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone., I'm sorry.We were pissin' in the wind the whole time. Oh shit., The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help.You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count., Grandma, wait!! Don't--, Holy shit.Don't drop it Rose.(a fierce whisper) Rush her.Aww!! That really sucks, lady!Would you like to dance?, Don't come any closer.You had it the entire time?!(to Bodine) It's hers, you schmuck.I have.

I have some column ideas I want to bounce off you. Not there? Okay. Listen I'm thinking of writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on. What do you think? Good idea, right? Boring, down to death, pointless -- It sucks. If you guys are here any longer, they're gonna make you sign a lease., Okay, I was also thinking I might write about... Excuse me. I was thinking of doing an article on limousines. What would you say to people who never had a chance to drive in a limo?I'm sorry, I don't know any people like that., When your t-shirts stop shrinking., (into phone) Fisher? Come on -- I know you're sitting there laughing at me. Pick up. I want to run an idea past you. (into phone) I just could use someone to toss it back and forth with for a few minutes, get the juice flowing, help me. I have an hour and twenty-seven minutes and fifty-two seconds. Hello?Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me in an article?, (as she exits) That's last minute man.Not as private as I thought. Kevin, you've got some napkins?Writing or wiping?... They're up, they're down. It's really fun making this list with you, but I've got a column to go write., You know, for a good looking man, you strike out a lot.Ike.(undeterred) But you don't have a really superb idea! Well, there's a girl from my hometown you could write about.(to Man) Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas., I've seen much worse. I said, I've seen much worse.Excuse me?The brush-off. I've witnessed far more treacherous and nefarious exits than that. At least she castigated you in private.Give me a pen.(throwing darts hard) Ah, come on. They deserve it. They love you, they hate you, they're hot, they're cold, they're high, they're low...She likes to dump grooms right at the altar. They call her "The Runaway Bride". She performed the travesty seven or eight times. Right at the altar she turns around and runs like hell. Bolts. Adios. Plows down the aisle, knocking old ladies out of her way like the running of the bulls at Pamplona. And guess what?I give up.She has the next victim all lined up. She's twirling another body on the spit. (beginning his story) Imagine if you will, a small town in Maryland..., So what's in store for us in tomorrow's column?I don't know yet. I'm kind of a last- minute man. Ideas don't flow until an hour or two before deadline.(interrupting) This is very interesting. You get your ideas for your column from life. You start up a conversation with a woman in a bar, attack her choice of reading material, try and get a rise out of her while you contemplate whether or not she's worth hitting on.No, I can't hit on you until I get an idea.That's flattering.No, you don't understand.I think I do understand. So my not responding to your baiting me will inspire one of those potential bitter diatribes you love to write about women and all the things we do to drive men crazy?(taken aback) I don't write bitter diatribes about women... very often.Only when the ideas aren't flowing, huh? Well, it was very nice to meet you, one-minute man., I see photos of a lot of dead writers on these walls. Got any living ones? I have a story to tell that could win one of them a Pulitzer., (reading) "Today is a day of profound introspection, I have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex! This uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least fifteen minutes of serious reflection, from which I have emerged with the conclusion that, yes -- I traffic in female stereotypes.", "But how can one blame me when every time I step out my front door I meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well? Te mother, the virgin, the whore, the crone; they're elbowing you in the subway, stealing your cabs, and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators.", "But perhaps, in fairness to the fairer sex, I do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon: I would like to nominate for deity...", "... The cheerleader, the coed, and the man-eater, the last of which concerns me most today.", You noticed these are all countries without cable. (then, continues reading), (reads) "To be fair, the man-eater isn't exactly new. In Ancient Greece, this fearsome female was known as Erinys, the devouring death goddess. In India, she is Kali, who likes to devour her boyfriend Shiva's entrails while her yoni devour his -- dot dot dot, never mind. In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater is called Ragma...", (takes paper from her, reads), "... And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family hardware store."Holy moly.(reads) "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore., (bright) Here we go! One antique hot water handle with the "HOT" still on it, guaranteed to fit any American Standard cast iron tub with a four-inch center made between 1924 and 1938. In other words, I think you're out of the doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on your account., Maybe she hasn't read the paper... ... Or not!Holy moly.Um, you know, now would be a good moment to tell me this is fake. (sitting) Bag.Bag., (walking past customer) You don't need an air conditioner, Earl, you just need an attic fan -- There's more in the back. What?(delicate) So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?(serious) Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me! You guys! How long did this take you? Where'd you get this done?, You tell Maggie.No, you tell her.No, no. You're her best friend.No.(holding her newspaper)Yeah.Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette jokes, so we didn't..., "Dear Editor...", "Greeting from the sticks! Perhaps you believe that a rural education is focused mainly on hog calling and tractor maintenance rather than reading. Why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact?" "I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy thinking us slanderous statements about how I dump men for kicks to bother with something silly like accuracy in reporting. Which is understandable, because with a "man-eater" like me on the loose, who has time to check facts?", "Still, we cannibalistic queens can get pretty cranky when we see things in print that hurt our feelings, like that we deliberately abandon fiances with malice aforethought.", You can go in now., (to Elaine) I'll put in a good word for you.No, no, don't mention my name in there.Why?, "That's why I was surprised to find Mr. Graham's editor was a woman. Call me a sentimental fool, but I sort of hoped we man-eater could stick together.", So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.In vino veritas., I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent. If you go quietly, I'll get you severance pay., (reading letter) "Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham's column on a platter. Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter. P.S. -- I have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article. There are fifteen."(chuckles as he sits) Fully. I like her. She has wit.I left four messages. You don't return my calls.Since when does Ellie need moral supp---- It's for you, Ike.What?Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving. Besides, I'm a columnist. This is what columnists are supposed to do. This is what you like. We push, we stretch, we go out on a limo. That's what makes me good!No, that's what makes you unemployed.I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.Not anymore. I have to draw the line. (pushing a piece of paper)(scoffs) Lawyers.(shrugs) I already made an appointment for later today.(putting the list down, standing), Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?, She canned him, she canned him...Come here, Mag, and try this on.Listen: "Dear Ms. Carpenter, I apologize to you for this unfortunate matter. Ike Graham's column will no longer be appearing in this paper. Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!"That-a-girl! You sacked him., It's a little... It's a little heavy... Help me, baby., Remember, we are putting the "fun" back into formal., Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...What are you trying to say to me, Fish?Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.(hiding his hope) The real story on Miss Carpenter.All the gory details.(excited) The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.(enthusiastically) This is good. It is a good story, Fish.(nods) If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.(confesses) Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot."Paid vindication" That's what I call justice.Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.But I'll get my normal fee, right? You want me to do it on spec?!, Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance..., Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car. I'm going to make this work, Fish. I'm going to do it!, I think I'm in Maryberry., Mrs. Pressman. No relation., (to Peggy) Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.(delighted as she spins)I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.(yelling to Peggy) Reporter?Yup!Excellent.Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.Great.Yes.(calming) Let's just put this back here for the aromatherapy., She swallowed her gun.Oh, I will., Sorry, no. I just got one.(to Ike) Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.(steps to Mrs. Pressman) Yes, Mrs. Pressman.It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.Good fact. Well, you let me know., Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...Are you a reporter?(shocked) What?(eyeing his loafers) It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.About her upcoming wedding and all.No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.I am just such a reporter. And you are?Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.And you are?(turning toward her) Looking for Maggie.You'll answer my questions? (removing his jacket) Fine. You wash, I'll ask the questions., Cindy. Maggie's unmarried cousin., Cindy, you better 86 Sprout. He seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates.That's it. Back to obedience school., And who are these lovely ladies?, I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.Originality is my speciality.She's the boss.I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it.Have a seat. Peggy, why don't you give him the special treatment that strengthens the follicles. So, what do you want to know?Getting nervous?Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?, Yes, I think I nailed the personality profile of the women of Hale. (to Peggy) My jacket, please. (sarcastically) Thank you. (putting on jacket; to Pete), I'm inside the church. Everyone I know is there, only they're not really them. They're like Frankenstein monsters, but without the bolts coming out of their necks. It's all very "Night of the Living Dead". And here's the creepiest part -- I look down at my dress and it's red. I mean, I have no idea what it means. Red's not my color! So what do you think?You're all ready for football season, Mr. Graham.No thanks., I think you'd look good in red., (to Peggy) He seems crabby., In another one...Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.No, she's talking about your hair., If you're looking for Elm Street, it's that way.Thank you.If you came down here in the pursuit of happiness, you might as well go back. Because you can't make me feel bad.I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart...You have one?I feel I'm right about you. You got me fired, lady. You destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair. You chew men up, spit them out and loved it. And I'm down here to satisfy myself on that point.Did something happen to make you care about reality?Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.You're going to be very disappointed.We'll see.I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job. I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham. Talk to whoever you want. You might actually stumble upon a fact or two., Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for your hat., Who? (innocently) Hello, Maggie. I just came by to apologize to your family.In other words -- he's only human. An he brought us a bottle of wine.They made me put my hat back on.Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.That's okay, Grandma. (continuing his thought) ... Like such a lovely girl.Like her mother.She has a tape?(good-natured) Yeah. Lee at the hotel videos wedding. I mean Maggie didn't know she was going to make the hundred-yard dash.Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday..., You know, when I only see one dog, I know I've had too much to drink.Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of Skipper., You'll never guess who came crawling into town with his tail between his legs., Check on the crabs, Bob.You know, your daughter seems...Sorry.(seeing the portrait) Ah, beautiful. (gets up to admire the portrait)Oh, yes, you can. She's has 'em all on tape., Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels. Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.(sarcastically) Ha ha., You've got to be kidding me.(enjoying the moment) No, no, you should have seen Skipper. (then, imitates growling)So, the forces of good and evil have already met., I'll help you take into the kitchen., That's right, Maggie. Just keep your eye on the ball. Sports psychology. It was my major in college.Ahh.My girl likes to brag about me. I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on our honeymoon., Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again.(false modesty) I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer. Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success. You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.(sticking it to Ike) Without oxygen..., Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak., Not this one. This one's on me.That's fair.(boasting) Bob's the head of the P.E. department at the high school. And he coaches the football team. And he's climbed Everest.(impressed) Everest. Is that right?Twice...Really?How romantic.(sharply) We think so., Emma and I were only blessed with one child, not for lacking of trying.This is good, Dad, don't leave anything out.So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings., (to Fisher; into phone) You won't believe what I'm looking at, Fisher. A videotape of all three train wrecks.Kamikaze!, Did you see that?, But he's got the Bobster's eyes. No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set. (to Mrs. Trout) Could I have two coffees, please? And what is that wonderful smell? (seeing the cinnamon rolls)Sure. (picking up a miniature bride)Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute? Ahh... Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Oh, help me! Help me! Yup! That's her all right.You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.Yes, I am. And who are you?Betty Trout. Five dollars.(as he pays) Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --(cynical delight) A pre-wedding luau?Yes. My husband and I love luaus. It'll be fun.Fun? Fun isn't the word.No.(handing him the other bag), This one's very popular, but oh, you've used this one before... Brian. But I like the white dinner jacket.No, he's no good. Too blond.(picks up another) We'll go with total traditional.(interrupting) -- The luau for Maggie.If you're still in town, you should stop by., He's not a nice person., Too dark.(all smiles for Mrs. Trout)No, I'm sure he doesn't.(to Mrs. Trout) Actually, I would love to come.(exasperated) Is that what you're going to do now? Follow me around everywhere I go?Bye, Betty. Thanks., Ike just came by to check out the team.I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot of work to do today! I'll see you two love-birds later.See you at the wedding., You're jail bait, Dennis. Go away. Run your laps. Go. Go.Drive! Drive! From your hips, get low, get low, get low. Next! Good job, gentlemen... Special teams. (to Maggie) Hey, honey!(indicating Ike) What is he up to now?Bob -- are you making friends with this man?At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.You don't understand this guy.Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."(irritably) I'm not running.So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.Where's that homemade sunshine? I want you boys to take my princess on the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em where you parked your car., (playful) Maggie, don't marry Coach! Marry me. I love you., And talk about you.You bet ya, Coach., (still inside the booth)You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you really shouldn't come to confession.I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out about that slime-ball reporter being in town. I jus had to come warn you he might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous questions.Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question. The rest weren't so bad.(sliding along the pew)Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.Only respectful things. What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...And what did you say?How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?(relieved) Good one! Thanks.It happens to be how I feel.God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...God bless you, Maggie.Oh, wait, my purse. Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse. Good luck. Wait -- what was the ridiculous question he asked?He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.Weird. Like after all those years you would remem--(interrupting) -- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and dill. Same as me.(tenderly) I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?Of course.Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?, Father, am I too late?No, no.It won't take long. Jus two venials., (impatient) The name's Maggie. It wasn't this side of ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat. So don't call me "child", Brian. It annoys me.Of course., What did he ask?, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was... ahh... ... Anyway, I have sort of a technical question here. I've been having -- bad thoughts. I mean, really bad thoughts ...Of an impure nature?No -- like -- I'm having a problem with that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept. I want revenge. I want to destroy this guy's life, career, everything. On the sin scale, how big is that? I mean, can I "Hail Mary" my way out of it?Child, any sin in one's heart is..., We went to San Francisco twice. Remember one time we had a flat tire... Which picture?But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.Completely.Maggie? You got it removed?Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if was a stick-on.Look.I think I am. Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?, Gill? Lydia? Gill?Hey -- I found it!Found what?Mags! Hey, look -- The tape from the Radio City Music Hall concert -- Remember that night I as trying to get Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"? (disappointed) Oh, I'll play it for you.(shouts over the music) Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell ... If he comes by here, don't talk to him. And whatever yo do.... What was that?Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, Mags. I said "You're on, man! Maggie loved that thing!" And I could really use fifty bucks. (looking worried) Mags?(dismayed) Maggie?(admitting) I'm really, really afraid of needles... It doesn't make me a bad person.He is not!, (feigning shock) Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena.Give me that!I'm not gonna show you guys anything. I am a soon-to-be-married woman. Now give me that photograph.Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.Fine. Here. (turning back around) Satisfied?(sincerely) Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.Jerry. He'd play. He'd play... Jerry would play his heart out., Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me.For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.It's probably because you got him fired.(sarcastic) Ya think?Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.Where?Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man.I'd say you've been in the sun too long. You handle him, okay? I could use five minutes off from that creep.(looking at Maggie and Cory) I'll be back in a second., Okay, that's fine. I can do that.Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater".(protesting weakly) That's Maggie's seat...... And this is Maggie's beer. That your husband out there? Cory Phleming, a local radio announcer.Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.That must have made you proud.He was going with Maggie back then. Good job, honey!It's nice that they're still friends., You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?You can turn that finger around.(defensive) You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me., See, I cheer good. What is he, a cheer critic?, (to herself) This guy never stops., Lee, hey, wake up. Give me the key to the reporter's room. I want to snoop around.(handing her the key) Okay. Second floor.Thanks.Don't take anything big., (reads) "How does she get all these guys to propose? She's not that beautiful." (as she takes post-its) Rude..., All right, I know you're in there... You steal my research... You're messing with the first amendment now. Open up. Open up. You got no place to go., Thief!, I want to have a very serious discussion with you as to why you're such a pain in the ass., That's breaking and entering. I'll call the sheriff., You do that. And remind him he's bringing the wine to the luau. Thanks., Thanks. Will you fix my hair?, Do you think I flirt with Cory?Good morning to you, too. You look good.Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?Yes.I don't mean it.I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?Like certain kinds of coral.I'm going to kill myself.Why?Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".(friendly) No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.But I'm weird.No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.I think you're right.Something that brings warmth to my heart.It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up., Freeze. Hold on to those covers -- I didn't come here to see Ike Junior.I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.(deadpan) How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.Coffee. Now.You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.Really.I've decided to cooperate and let you interview me. I want a big wedding and a killer dress and for a grand I will answer all your questions and let you follow me around.My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards.(to Maggie) You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.Too much.Seven-fifty.Five hundred.Six-fifty.Done., Pardon the mess. I haven't cleaned since the fifth grade., What's this over here?It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.Cindy the manicurist.No, the other one.(laughing) This is wonderful. You reconfigure all these industrial parts and you do something amazing with it. Amazing. Found industrial stuff. Willow lamp... Rasta lamp... Is this your preferred logo?I think so.I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible.Maybe someday.You afraid to try?(stares at him) No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible., What an incredible chauvinistic observation., That's Brian's. He took me ut canoeing on the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box. (defensive) It was classic. Gill. Of course. He proposed at the tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert. It was very sweet until he hallucinated that the drum set was a blood-sucking space alien.Always a mood killer.Still sweet. George. He proposed at a butterfly farm in St. Thomas. The ring was inside a cocoon.(grimacing) It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique. And here we are at Bob. He proposed during the seventh inning stretch... ... At an Oriole's game.Wait. Don't tell me. The scoreboard lit up with "Mary me, Maggie."It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded.(stopping) Highly suspect.What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. I think the most anybody can honestly say is, "Look..." (sits on the arm of the couch)I like it. I'd like it better on a scoreboard. Don't look so surprised, you've got divorce written all over you.I'm a work in progress.So? Is that what you said to her?No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?I don't know.You don't know.No.Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?Call me crazy, but I believe that check I gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while.Fair enough. I'll just need one more day to make sure your check clears.Ow!, Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress., Agreed., I didn't drag.You've come for your dress. Good! I'll get it from the back.(happily) Actually, I would like to get this dress.(to Polly) Polly, take Leslie into change.(pleasantly) Yes. But I've changed my mind.It's one thousand dollars.I have one thousand dollars.(firmly) The other one is only three hundred dollars.Is this dress for sale?It just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie... You only wear them for about ten minutes., Mrs. Whittenmeyer. May I talk to you for a second? I don't know much about this kind of thing. I'm from out of town. You're a salesperson, right? You're here to sell wedding dresses.(huffy) Yes. I've been here for thirty years.Perfect. Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one. But not just any one. She wants that one.It's a thousand dollars!Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or I'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with India ink.Shhhh! The man has ink!, (to the mother) She'll be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughter's wedding.Mr. Whittenmeyer. Hi, Polly!Hi, Maggie. You'll have to excuse her, Maggie. Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle., Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet Bob!, Yeah, that's a good point.Tough to spend money in this town.What do you think?(stammering) You look... uh... You look fine.Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.Bob will be very happy., Will he really do that?(whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer) It's a thousand dollars., I'll have the same.(clears his throat) Of course.Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?You know, there's no..., Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done., Tootaloo., Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to order.We're out the special because somebody..., Let me have the garden omelette. Egg whites only.What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?Neutral corners you two. You're on the same team now. Any more fighting and it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.(quietly) Right., (to Ike) I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise. All the sports shrinks use this head stuff. Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift. Here's today's mantra: "It's an open field to Big Bob.", Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss., I'd like to explain about the weddings. There are reasons why they didn't come off. Three weddings, no "I do's". You can't believe how much cake we were left with. I should weigh three hundred pounds. I don't think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank.Right, cover your ears, Netta. It's not that she's afraid of the wedding, she's afraid of the wedding night. Innocent girls are terrified of "the one-eyed snake".Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one- eyed snake awhile ago.Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'll tell you one thing, your grandpa didn't forget that wedding night., Ike... Hi, Grandma.Can you excuse us a minute?Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.I found this and didn't know if it was something interesting.(excited) Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?(casual) It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.It's valuable. Hang onto it.No. You take it.Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?, No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible., Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him., (without difficulty) Ike... Please don't write anything about this --No. Forget about it. Don't even think about it.Watch your leg, Dad.I was talking to the dog.Okay... I'll just grab my jacket., (coaxing) C'mon. Let's go.(belligerently) I haven't had any fun since you got your driver's license...I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.(to Dog) Good boy, Port Hole.His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.I changed it. Good daughters let their fathers pass out., My dad managed a business and two mistresses. He wanted me to be a novelist. More? My mother wanted me to become a musician. 0 for two. But at least I'm a journalist and we all know journalism is literature in a hurry., You're sure well known around here., Yeah, we need a half and nine- sixteenths., Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded.Can you fix it?First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.(removing his glasses) Of what?(in amazement) Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.Kind of isolated.Yeah. It's kind of nice.There's one thing we New Yorkers know how to do is hail a cab. If there's no cab, we walk.I can get some tools over there.... and save the battery... There's one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field. It's quicker. Be careful of snakes.Snakes? Are you serious? I don't like snakes. I've never even seen a snake.Do you think there's only one right person for everybody?No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.Lionel, can I borrow some tools?, Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything. (lightly) I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence., I don't know., (into phone) Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?(into phone) No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?, (into phone) Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.You're coming here?(into phone) Yeah.Then come for dinner.(into phone) Okay, we'll order out.Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?..., Poached, just like me., Get this man a Kamikaze.Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.(whispers) You could have told me you were fiance number three.And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned.Thanks.She's a cacophony of contradictions.Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?(taking a sip of his drink)(sarcastic) Neuter a locust, feed the world.You know Maggie was the only girl I ever met who would hold my tarantula. On the first date.So, tell me, George, why do you think she ran?Same as you said. What did you call her? A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."I don't think that's why she ran.Why do YOU think she ran?I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.And you defending her?No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.Unbelievable, she got to you.(protecting, taking his tape recorder out of his pocket) What kind of eggs did she like?, Oh, please!, (sarcastically) Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.(into phone) ... Just call me when you have it.Or a vegetarian?Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?(in shock) Ike is turning sensitive and I can't bear to watch. I'm going to make a fresh pot of tea., Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..." Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.Fisher, let him talk.(into phone) Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye.Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?No. No, you didn't.(heartfelt) Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie., I'm sorry, too., No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...(sits) But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be., May the pitter-patter of little feet not be Maggie's., You know the old saying, "You're not losing a daughter..." Well, I'd like to! Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke..., May the back of the dress be as pretty as the front!, Attention. Listen to Walter. Listen close, he slurs.In the tradition that has grown through the years, it is now Toast Time! First up, our host, "A Honey of a Beekeeper", Lou Trout.., (grabbing the microphone) King and Queen, dance. Everybody dance. Pictures of the King and Queen., May the gifts be returned!, Lighten up, wahine.Lighten up, what?This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.(nods to door) Would it? What are you doing?, That was funny., Oh, she just went to get me something from the car., Missed me bad, huh? TIME CUT:You want me to make a toast? Okay... I'll give you a toast. To Maggie's family and friends. May you find yourselves the bull's eye of an easy target. May you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes..., (after a beat) I'm going to go dance with Bob. Because he's the man.You got something without a toy in it? TIME CUT: Aloha. That's a very fetching headdress you're wearing.Where did you disappear to?I don't know, give me a minute.Excuse me?Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?Yes., Oh, look, Mr. Graham, how about a toast?, Not now.(calling after her) Maggie. Maggie.Where'd Maggie go?, I don't and I don't think you should...It's a joke. They're kidding., Hey, Bob. I got twenty dollars bet on--, Stop. Stop it! I'm getting married on Sunday, and you're just trying to make me run! Why? Because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit! And all you do is tear other people down and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself! I read your column. You never wrote one about you. I'm not the only one who's lost and you know it! Am I right? Well? Am I right?Mag. Help me out here. Green Bay. Right guard. You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut ... Are you okay?Yes.Let me take you back inside, okay?, Jerry Kramer., I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.You humiliated me!No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again. -- Tell me something, do you really care about Mount Everest?It's fun! It's high.Or the sexual habits of locusts?That was very interesting research George was doing!What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?I already explained about that.And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?(wincing) Brian told you that?Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.Lost!That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.What!?With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.That's called changing your mind.No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.Yes I do!No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right? Am I right?, Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding? She's already done this., Bob is making her visualize the ceremony., (to Maggie) Okay, we're ready. Want me to have Ike leave now?(sarcastically) Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect., Team effort, Pastor Ike... Cindy, ready?, No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.I'd rather not., Go!, It's for the bell.Bob's in a hurry.Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball.""Sink the putt.""Make the shot.""Nothing but net.", He's going to be the pastor?Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.What happened at the luau?(flustered) ... I don't even want to talk about the luau."Never say die.", Honey, are you okay?(taking off his jacket) At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.Okay, I'm the pastor. Dearly beloved, blah, blah, blah. So on and so forth. Ra ta ta ta. Yabada dabada. I now pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the bride, badum dum. Maggie!!!!? (furious) If you were imagining me, you did great.What do you expect me to say to this?How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?, Hold it! Hold it! I think we're taking this too fast. We need to limber you up a little. You're tensing. (thinks a moment; to Ike, moving him to groom's spot) Visualize! Visualize! It's game time. You are the football. You're spiraling through the air towards the hands of the groom.(eyes down) Yes, I'm spiraling through the air. I streak towards the goal line. And I land on the goal line.(dazed but happy) I kissed him back.Yeah, I caught that. Want to tell me how long this has been going on?Really?I hope you'll be very happy together., (eyes on Maggie) I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.About a minute...?A little longer for me., (to Peggy) Take care of him., So, we'll..., Bob, I'm sorry! Some woman is going to make you a lot happier than I ever could... See?Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs. Pressman: "Holy moly". Call me later., Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.Me, either.(blathering) I love you. I love you.(blathering) I love you, too.Wait. We have to talk. We have to do some talking now. Pull up a railing. You have to go down an aisle and say "I do". You have to get married.To who? Are you asking me?Me?Yes, you!(thinks) Well, you do have the dress.And the church.And the wedding date. There's the two of us.I'm okay with that.So am I., I'm getting married., Good night., Ike's going to get married. (without turning to him) Fisher, if you pee on that Persian, I'll kill you., I love his eyes. I just believe they're listening to you., (to Cindy) See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it., I like his tight butt., His hair... any color., Grandma!, Wedding bells are ringing for the fourth time today in Hale, Maryland. Maggie Carpenter, "Always a Bride -- Never a Bridesmaid", will be attempting to complete her fourth wedding ceremony. We'll come back on the air when the results are in. Back to you, Jessica., The bride's been here for almost an hour, but being around in the beginning was never her problem. We'll be here, showing you the full wedding ceremony, we hope., I got "Bye-bye Birdie". "What part of 'I do' don't you understand?"... Get your "Runaway Bride" T-shirts here..., (moves to window) He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming.No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V".You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.He's here!... He's here!Now's the time for calm... If you don't calm down, you won't get your dress on..., Not eight...Rub your ears.Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.We'll rub.He's here! He's here!, We have to hurry. The Sunday School kids will be here soon., And in a "V".Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.We do it to our dog.It's hurting.I'll get the dress.This is not a good sign., Ike Graham is here!, Well, the groom just pulled up. There was talk of a "now show", but he is here., No, I'm not., Shoot ours so she has one with an ending. (pleading) Mrs. Pressman, please.It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun., Friends. Thank you. Thank you. We are friends, aren't we, Fisher?(grinning) Of course we are. Of course.Then you'll be my best man.Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.(to himself) Eye contact. Eye contact. Cover me., You always looked great in that suit... And Ike? I'll have a car around the back to whisk you out of here if she runs., You look awful.(sarcastically) Thank you.Ike. Need help? I'm glad it's you.Really?I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.Got any last minute advice?(motioning to their eyes) Maintain eye contact., Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do., Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!, You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.Thank you., (to Ike) I have no idea what I'm doing.Your job is... the ring.You just pull a hair from my neck., I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?Oh, come on. You're practically family.Hello. I'm Fisher.This doesn't want to come out., Thank you, Grandma.(quietly to Maggie) I'm really rooting for this one., Let's go., Good luck, Maggie., Thank you, Dad., Spit., No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there., Hi, I'm Elaine from New York.Hello. I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth attempt.I'm sorry.That's okay. There's a lid for every pot. Besides, I'm comfortable with Ike. I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his heavyweight title to a New Yorker., I know. Gene Tunney., They're ready, Maggie., Just a second., (yelling out) Block the doors!, Maggie!, There's a man coming down those steps with lots of candy in his pockets. If you tickle him, he'll give candy., Maggie!, Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten- thirty tomorrow., Maggie!Poor Ike.(running; yells) Maggie!, Look, he's running after her.Look, he's in pretty good shape.Where do you think she's going?, (softly) Hi, Dennis.I am going to propose, you know. I mean, the right way. Soon as I turn eighteen.You're sweet, Dennis. But you've got to go. I'm closing up. Here's a candy bar and one for your brother., I'm not giving up. A person shouldn't give up., You okay? I'm closing.I'm just finishing up, too.Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?(interrupting) No, I'm just going to head home.Okay. (stepping closer and making a "V" with her fingers)What are you talking about?Wedding. Wedding.Thank you. You still think that he was...., (whispers) Marry me, Maggie., Quick. Very quick., Honey, your grandmother and I were thinking about opening a wedding gift museum.STOP!What?(quiet fury) Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.(putting down the oranges) Maggie, it's just a joke...No. It's my life.A harmless joke., She's been doing this since the last wedding. I don't think it's good.Hey. Grandma, what's for lunch?No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.That needed to be said. You know -- you're always making jokes about her, so they won't make jokes about your drinking., That's Maggie. Home for lunch.Turkey and cheese., I need a plan... A plan to life... What would Bruce Lee do? He'd kick some ass..., Hello, Ike.Don't tell me. My doorman is one of your many admires... I knew I should have given him a better Christmas gift.I've been making friends with your cat.I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics.I don't blame you for being mad... ... Or... furious. ... Irate? Livid? How's that?Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.It's something I've always wanted to do.You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. (after opening the glass doors)I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.(after sitting) Does it matter?I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.Yes, I did.I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.No, I couldn't fix anything..., I understand why you bring up the truck. Let me explain something. The fact is, you've seen me at my worst, most embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably, psychotic state. And if you liked me then, I mean, now... I can't imagine... I love eggs Benedict. I hate all the other kinds. ... I hate big weddings with everybody staring. I would like to get married on a weekday while everybody is at work. If I ride off into the sunset, I want my own horse.Should I be writing this down? What's this?These are for you.Used?They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.This is getting serious.And one more thing. I know it's hard to believe there could be more. Um... If you could have a seat, please.(laughing) Oh my God. No.No, no -- don't hide your face, this only happens once in a lifetime. It's definitely a first to me, and you're not going to want to miss it. I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham. Will you marry me?Maggie, I gotta think about this a little bit.(cheerful) Good. I was hoping you'd say that.(laughing) You were not.I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. (pulling up a chair and sitting)I'm listening.(tenderly) "I guarantee that we'll have tough times. I guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".Pretty good speech, Maggie.I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?Dance with me., 0938_0000, 0938_0002,0938_0003, 0938_0006, 0938_0004,0938_0005, 0938_0017,0938_0022,0938_0023,0938_0026, 0938_0018,0938_0027,0938_0028,0938_0029,

thought I'd see --I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.Of course. Please have a seat. (quietly into headset) It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just -- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- (gravely, patting the manuscript), May I help you?(approaching reception area) Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski., Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you., I better do this, Stan. Ms. Kruczynski?Hi.(professionally courteous) How are you today?Okay, I guess., Yes?Howard, your one o'clock.(not looking up) Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in. (looking up) Mary...(turning back) Yes?Order me a pastrami for after?Cole slaw, ice tea?(nodding) Thanks.(at Mierzwiak's office) Here we are., Welcome, Howard.Boo.Hi.Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.(reprimanding whisper) Stan... c'mon...Sorry. I just --(somewhat guiltilly) It's just...y'know... I mean...I know. Anyway --Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.See you later, alligator.'kay.Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --, Ms. Kruczynski, please come in., How are you today?Okay, I guess.(nodding sympathetically) Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?I don't care. Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with hm?What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay. Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there., Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --, Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I'm not feeling well this morning. No. Food poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me so long to call in, but I've been vomiting., January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk., (calling) And some cream, please., Coffee?God, yes. You've saved my life!You know what you want yet?(laughing) Ain't that the question of the century. You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?Yeah. We're having a run on it., I just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on. Damn it. DAMN IT!, (calling over the rumble) Hi!I'm sorry.Why?Why what?Why are you sorry? I just said hi.No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...Really?(embarrassed) Well, I didn't want to assume.Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.Anyway. Sorry. Hi.It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.Oh. So...I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --It's okay, really.Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.Rockville Center.Get out! Me too! What are the odds?The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.Really? Because --Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.I don't have one.I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.Ah, the hair. (pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it)I like it.Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?I can't remember.Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.I don't really know how --Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?(pissy) Someone's got that job.I'm sure you would.My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.You sure? That doesn't sound --I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?Oh, I doubt that's the case.Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.Yeah, I got it. My name's Clementine, by the way.I'm Joel.No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.I don't know any jokes about your name.Huckleberry Hound?I don't know what that means.Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?I'm nut nuts.(singing) Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?(impressed) Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.See, I wouldn't think that about you.(pissy) Why wouldn't you think that about me?Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.Well, anyway... Sorry.What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides an adjective? I guess it can be an adverb, sort of. It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is pandering. Cowardly. And life is more interesting than that. Or should be. Jesus God, I hope it is... someday. I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.Okay.Joel? It's Joel, right?Yes?I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.That's okay.(stares out window) My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... (stands, throws bag over shoulder)(pulling journal from briefcase)(heading toward other end of car), Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.No, that's okay. Thanks, though.You're sure? It's cold.I don't want to take you out of your way.It's okay.Yeah?Where do you live?You're not a stalker or anything, right?Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.I'm not a stalker.(beat) You know Wilmont?Yeah.Wilmont. Near the high school. Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.It's okay. I didn't think you were.So you like bookstores, huh?I like to read.Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?Sort of, um...Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."What?I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.Well, I wouldn't want to be --Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.Take care.(turning back) Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --Um --, Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel., Thanks. I like it, too. Been here about four years. It's really cheap. My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great. And the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and I have a little porch in the back, which is great, because I can read there, and listen to my crickets and... Two blue ruins... You like that?Very much.This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?I don't know.Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.Frost?(impressed) Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?It's pretty.I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!Cheers.God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.I'm fine.Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway. Ready for another?No, I'm okay for now.Well, I'm ready. Put some music on.What do you want to hear?You pick it.You just say. I'm not really --I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good. Oh, excellent choice. Mmmmmmm. Way to go, Joel. You pick good.Well, I should probably get going.No, stay. Just for a little while.No. I --I know a man who needs a refill.Thanks.Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. I'm just kidding. C'mon. Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.Yeah?Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?I don't know.Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?Yeah, I guess.(dreamy beat) But I think I am. I like to think I am. It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.Oh.I think about that.You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.I do have a tendency to use that word too much.I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.Thanks.And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?Yeah.(ala Paul Simon) What's the goal, Joel?Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?Yeah.You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?No.I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?No, not at all.I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. (off his reaction) Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.Oh, yeah.That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.That's scary sounding.Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?I think so.I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.Okay.Yeah? Oh, great! I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --(shy) Sounds good. But right now I should go.(pause) You should stay.I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...(beat) Okay. I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.Yes. I don't think your personality comes out of a tube. I think the hair is just... a pretty topping. (shyly formal) So, I enjoyed meeting you.You'll call me, right?Yeah.When?Tomorrow?Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all., Okay., He hears a key in his apartment door., It's too late., We're sorry, the number you have dialed...Fuck., It was snowing.There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.The driver waved. So casual, friendly.I'm like a joke to them. I guess they figure they can act like they want. They don't have to worry about me remembering.I might be making a mistake.Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.Fuck you, Clementine. Pink.The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.Bye. It's them., How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?, I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.You were not.I was not.Come over after I'm done here?I can't. I want to, but I have to study.You rat.(to Patrick) You didn't say anything about my hair.It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.In the room?, What's happening here?, I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.In the world., I should maybe talk to you.Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...Clementine., That's your look for me., Them., Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!, Hello again, Mr. Barish. Good, you've got your stuff., (not looking back) How are you today?, How exactly is this going to work tonight?We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.It's happening now! I'm already in my brain., Mr. Barish.We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.But you're tracing and erasing now. It's already started. I'm home in my bed., Ah, Mr. Barish. This is Stan. He'll be in charge of your procedure tonight.Yes, I suppose you are. (back in his faded memory persona)Very good.We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home., Good. We're getting healthy read-outs. Patrick, do me a favor -- -- and check the voltage levels, I'm not wiping as clean as I would like here., Yeah, that looks better. Thanks., The voltage looks fine.Then check the connections.Does that help?, (reading) December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long. I think we got this one. Let's push on., Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable., May I help you?My name is Joel Barish. I have an appointment., Please have a seat. Dr. Mierzwiak will be right with you., (without turning) How are you today?Not great., (at Mierzwiak's office) Here we are., I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.Well... I did.We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine., (thinks, then:) It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way..., It's kind of a dump, don't you think?, (uninterested) It's an apartment.Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us., Yeah. So who do you think is better-looking, me or this guy?, So we'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might remind you of her..., So then she just stops calling.I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.Any messages, Carmen? Any messages for me, Carmen.It's bullshit. She's punishing me for being honest with her., Sorry, Carmen. Any messages?, That's it. I'm just gonna--, She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.I don't think you should go there, Joel.I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!, Why would she do that?I don't know, honey. It's horrible.Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.(agitated, interrupting) Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog. Would you just wait here? Just a second. You weren't supposed to see that.They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax., Joel, look, the thing is --, Sweetie, we called the company.Lacuna: Noun. A blank, a missing portion, especially in a manuscript., You can't tell her, Joel. They explained that. Like waking a sleepwalker. It might have a devastating effect., Think about it: to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection.But what am I supposed to do?Move on, sweetie., How can I? How can I move on when I know I'm the only one to carry this love we had? How do I do that?, (dead monotone) Hi, May I help you?, So, Mary's coming over tonight., Patrick, we need to focus., Yeah?Just wanted to let you know.I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.She likes you okay.I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.You can if you want.Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?(re: memory on monitor) This one's history. Moving on...The thing is ... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation., It's three.Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said..., No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you? I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that. I just... I was just... pissed, I guess., Yo ho ho!Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic....a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody. I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.And what are you like? A wino?A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!, Shit. The last time I saw you.Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something., Let me drive you home.(without turning) Fuck you, Joel. Faggot., Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy. You did it to me. I can't believe you did this to me. By morning you'll be gone. Ha!, See, remember that girl? The one we did last week? The one with the potatoes?Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend. Was., I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.She was unconscious, Patrick.She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.Jesus, Patrick!, I know. It's not like... I mean, they were clean and all.Look, just don't tell me this stuff. I don't want to know this shit.Yeah, okay.We have work to do., In the bookstore that night. The skinny guy., Patrick... do you know how unethical..., That must be the guy I saw you with., Okay, but there's more. After we did her, I went to where she worked and I asked her out., How can you watch this crap?Where are you going?I'm fucking crawling out of my skin., Oh shit. I remember this.(pissy) I want to have a baby.Let's talk about it later.No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.I don't think we're ready.You're not ready.Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?What?!(mumbly) I don't want to talk about this here.Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it! You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --(screaming now) I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!Oh, thank God. It's going.It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!It's going, Clementine. All the crap and hurt and disappointment. It's all being wiped away.I'm glad., Me, too., So, um --S'okay, Mark. Joel doesn't like my boobs.You're drunk., You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --, (swiveling head toward him) Would you get me another, Joely? Thanky! Thanky! Joel, this is Mark. He likes my boobs. He came over special to tell me that. Isn't that nice. He doesn't think I'm fat., Definitely., (coolly) Oh, hey, Patrick.Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.(guilty beat) Okay, There's more, Stan --Hey, hey. Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?Nah, I don't know.I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?(trying to engage) Yeah. Cool."The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."Very cool. Trippy.Definitely!I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day., Hey, you.It's freezing out.You found us okay?Yeah.We haven't checked.Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders. Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.That's a good one.Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.It's a quote book.I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.Yup.Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?, Hi, Mary. How's it going?Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.(a little sulky) It's a good one all right.What's your bartlett's?(beat) Yup., You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.No, it isn't that.I want to know you.I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.Joel, you're a liar., Good. More?No. Thanks.How's the fish?, Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?, It's good., How's the chicken?, Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? -- Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I kind of have to study for my test --, Hold on. Let me ask my friend.Patrick, we're in the middle of --(sighing, to Patrick) Go., (quietly) Mary hates me., She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset., Let him go, Stan. I can help., (screaming) No! Jesus, No! Please! Please! I've changed my mind! (looks down at fading Clementine, then at ceiling), Joely...Yeah, Tangerine?Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?No.It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real., No., It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.(a sigh) Yeah.To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.You love him, don't you?, Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit., Oh, baby, what's going on?I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.Oh, Tangerine.Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense. Come up to Boston with me?Sure. We'll go next weekend and --Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!Um, okay. I'll call my study partner., Hi, it's Joel. Please leave a message after the beep., (whisper) Stan, it's Patrick. Pick up.Hey, where are you?I got into a situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man., I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway., I took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night. It was so beautiful and charming. Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me. We lay down right in the center and watched the stars. He took my hand and said "I could..., Thanks, Stan. I owe you., Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too., ...die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be. Clem, no! This can't keep happening. Please! Oh, fuck! Please!We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --You have to stop this!What? What do you mean?I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!, It's gorgeous., ... and we made love right on the ice. It was absolutely freezing on my ass! It was wonderful. I'm so excited. Yay!I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing. I didn't have a chance to wrap it., I don't know. Aaargh! It's horrible! I'm trapped!, Such a beautiful view.(looking at her) Yes indeed.Oh?I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?, I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.What if you hide me?What do you mean?(formulating) Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?Where? Where? Where?, She's so sexy., Jesus. What's this?I must be about two. (crying still) I want my mommy.I'm right here.I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose..., Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden., It's stopped.What?Listen, it's not erasing. It's not erasing. He's off the screen.Where?I don't know. He's not on the map. I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...Well, what should we do?I don't know! I just said that!Sor-ryShit!(definitely) We should call Howard.No way. I can handle this.This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan., (without making eye contact) Okay. Hello, Howard?, 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center., Stan? What's going on?The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.Well, where was Patrick?He went home sick.Jesus. All right, what's the address., Hell no. Shit, I'm so stoned. I don't want him to see me stoned. Stop being stoned, Mary!, He's coming?You better go., Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now., I really want her to pick me up. It's weird how strong that desire is.You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.You remember what happened next?I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like ---- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?There's this guy!What?There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.Really? Is he cute?He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!, How's my baby boy?, What's wrong with me?, Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met., Mary. What are you doing here?Let's get to the bottom of this. Shall we? Odd.I tried that already.Did you try going through C-Gate?Yeah. Of course., I'm going to do a Spectrum search throughout his memory, see if anything comes up. Okay, here it is. I don't know why it's off the map like that, but --, There he is. Oh my God. Oh my God. Do I look okay? I'm still stoned. Are you? Crap. (to Joel) Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.I wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible, Howard. I think it's important for my job...to help comfort the clientele. You know., She came to help, Howard., (to Clementine) I love getting bathed in the sink. It's such a feeling of security., (giggling) I've never seen you happier., Little baby getting awwwl cleean. Awl clean., Yeah, probably a good idea., Okay, we're back in.That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist., Well, thank you, Mary.(sighing) You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here., But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now., (mouthing to woman on screen) Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?, I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired., Oh dear., Howard, they've disappeared again., This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me., Hi, Jill.He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me Jill after this. Just shut up, Joe. I'm going home.I don't think so. We're fighting.I don't want to fight you.C'mon, Jill. Get up, faggot. C'mon., I'm too scared to even throw a punch. When I tell people this story I leave that part out., Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?, Poor Joel., I'm terrified. I thought if I hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and I could get my bike., We got him back. Stan, I think I'm just going to have to get through this manually. We're running late., Our house! Our house!Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you. Remember?, (mock offended) Joel!, (continuing to masturbate) I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --Joel, I was just --, Happy Birthday.(unwrapping the gift) Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy! Oh, Joel. It's beautiful!I scoured the city for it.I love it!, I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later., (pointing) That's where I live. Lived., It's okay. You were a little kid., I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl. I can't believe I did that. I'm so ashamed., I'm getting the hang of it. I still understand it. But I'm finding him quickly enough. I'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication.(not looking up) That's fine, Stan.Do you like quotes, Howard?How do you mean?Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."Is that Nietzsche?Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.(sputtering) There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.Alexander Pope?Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!It's no big deal.You are such a sweetheart. Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".That's lovely.Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.You're a wonderful girl, Mary.I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.(suddenly weepy) I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.We can't do this.No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.I want you to know it's not because I'm not interested. If that means anything., (a little giggly) I like watching you work., I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds., What? Oh my God!, Let me take you home., We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later., Hollis! Hollis!I knew it, Howard. I don't even know why I bothered to copy the damn address., (heroically) Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true. And it's not Mr. Mierzwiak's fault. I'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush. I basically forced him into it. I swear.Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the girl.Tell me what?Poor kid. You can have him. You did., It didn't start out to be this. I came here to work. It's a one-time mistake.What, Howard?, I want to go home., I could die right now, Clem. I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be., I love this book, Joel. Thank you so much for telling me about it.It was horrifying, seeing my father like that. There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure. And he saw failure in me, too, written in my future.Joel, you're not sewn in. He's wrong., I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.Yeah.I want to enjoy my little time left with you.This is our first "date" date.Do you remember what we talked about?Naomi, I guess.Yeah.What was I wearing?God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.Egad, were you horrified?No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.No, you were with me when I bought that. At that place on East 6th. It was later., Right. Something black though.I'll buy that. Black's always good.We did talk about Naomi.I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.I'm sure, I said.But you weren't. I could tell.I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences. I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:So what. Infatuation is good, too., And I didn't have an argument., I dropped you off after. You said --(Mae West) Come up and see me... now.It's very late.Yes, exactly. Exactly my point., This was our first time., Yeah, I know. Oh, God. Okay, well, I was so excited... ...Remember you bought me that little wind-up frog? And you said... "This is for your desk. Just a little token" I knew then... I knew something was going to happen... something wonderful., (shaky) Um, I liked you immediately. At the job interview. You seemed so... important and mature. And I loved that you were helping all these people. You didn't come on to me at all. I liked that. I was tongue-tied around you at first. I wanted you to think I was smart. You were so nice. I loved the way you smelled. I couldn't wait to come to work. I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just..., Naomi., On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying., I projected myself to the end of my life in some vague rendition of my old man self. I imagined looking back with a tremendous hole of regret in my heart., I didn't pick up the phone to call you, Naomi. I didn't pick up the phone., Yours?You take it. I don't know. Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really., I told her today I need to end it.Is that what you want?, I did it. I guess that means something., So what's going on, Joel?I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.What?Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --Don't say "we" when you mean "you."I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.No. I just need some space, maybe.The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems., It's not somebody else.I hate myself., Hi.I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.(seemingly uninterested) Yeah?I'd like to... take you out or something.Well, you're married.Not yet. Not married.Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.Okay.So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.I just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me.Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.I remember that speech really well.(smiling) I had you pegged, didn't I?You had the whole human race pegged.Probably.I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.I know.It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can., Is there a Clementine who works here?, Thanks, guys.I hope you feel better, sweetie.Yeah., Say hi to Naomi., I hope she's not up. I need to think., (full of sleep) Hi.Hi.How was it?You didn't miss much. Rob Carrie say hello.Hi, Rob and Carrie.Go back to sleep.Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold., In a minute.(more and more emotionless) I don't know what to do about this. I've been feeling so alienated and numb lately. Forever. The thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive. How can I continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? I need to speak with Clementine., I met someone tonight at a party on the beach. Her name is Clementine. There is something alive about her., This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over., So you don't mind?I've got to finish this chapter anyway.Me, too. Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!I hope you get your work done., (sighing) Yeah., Okay. I wish you could come., I told you that later., I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.I did. You said, things were fine.I remember.This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.Yeah, you told me that later., Just a little overworked, maybe.The trip to the party where I met Clementine. My first memory of her is now my last memory of her., Who was the girl you walked off with?No one., Is this the right way?, But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.Hi there.You said...I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.You did? You liked me?You know what I did.Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.You said --I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?Oh God, how horrid.Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?You mean, like...Yeah, like that.Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.(eyes welling) This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.I know.What do we do?No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.But my sleeping is really fucked up.I don't think I've slept in a year.You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.yeah?I'll give you a couple. See what you think.Okay.Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?I love her.Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.I think she's great.Me too. There's this poem --Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?I think, before.Seems too coincidental that way.Yeah, maybe. Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. I wish we did. You married?Um, no.Let's move into this neighborhood.I do sort of live with somebody though.Oh. Male or female?Female.At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree. Cool.What are you doing?It's freezing out here.C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.I hesitated for what seemed like forever.I could see you wanted to come in, Joel. As soon as you walked in. I knew I had you. You knew I knew that, right?, But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?And I just liked you so much.The grease on your chin in the bonfire light.No, it was lovely.Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear., You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the dark. Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.Hi.I was so nervous. What were you doing there, I wondered. Your hair was lime green. Green revolution.Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. I remember --I'm Joel.Enjoy it. Say good-bye. So you're still on the Zoloft?(whisper) Clementine., I --, I knew.I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.It's dark.Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?Naomi.Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.I think we should go.No, it's our house! Just tonight -- (looking at envelope on counter)(flat) So go.I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.(poking her head downstairs) What if you stay this time?I walked out the door. There's no more memory.Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one. Bye, Joel.I love you., I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs., (calling after her) I really should go. I really need to catch my ride., Did you have fun?, Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks. We can't come to --, Okay., Thanks, Stan. Thanks., So, I've got to drop the van off., You want to stop for coffee or something? Well, it was sure beautiful on that river. Thanks for sharing it with me. Well do it again soon., (heading toward the levator) Thanks, Stan. You're nice., Hey.(beat) Do you swear you didn't know?I swear.And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?Once, maybe. It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.How did I look?(beat) Happy. Happy with a secret.And after that?I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things. I really like you, Mary. You know that.Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.(thinking) You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car., Hi... Naomi? Yeah, hi! How are you? I know, I know. It's been a long time. Not too much. You? Oh, that's great! Congratulations! Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate? Tonight? I'm free. Okay, good!, I need this signed, Howard. Thanks.I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!I have a family, Mary.You made me have an abortion.It was a mutual decision.You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --, I didn't make you. You thought it best., (oddly cautious) So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.I'm sorry.Well, it was my fault -- the break-up. I'm sorry.Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --I miss you.Miss you, too.(trying for enthusiasm) Oh! Great. That's great!A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --I'm glad you called., I don;t know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny., So you think the dissertation will get published?, So you'll call me, right?Yeah.When?Tomorrow?Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines., Yeah., 'Night., Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.Hi.How's it going?Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.I know. I had to take the day to think.Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?I just got in.Long day thinking.Yeah, I suppose so.That's me.There you are.Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.I had a good time last night. I really did.So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.We'll speak soon., What took you so long?I just walked in.Hmmm. Do you miss me?Oddly enough, I do.Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.I guess so., Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice., Show me which constellations you know., Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.I don't know. This is so beautiful.Isn't it?I don't know. What if it breaks?What if?I think I should go back.Joel, come here. Please.Listen, did you want to make love?Make love?Have sex. Y'know --Oh, um...Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.That's okay. I --I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --Hey, Joel ---- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.I'm nervous, too.Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.Well, you obviously don't know me.I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you., Maybe. Call someone who'd know., Yeah?Did you send this? Is it a joke?I probably got the same thing as you.I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?(matter of fact) Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke., Yes, Joel. It is true. We weren't supposed to say anything. They say it's like waking a sleepwalker., Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely? Come over here, sweetheart. Please., It's true.I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.Look, I have to go. I have to think., Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.Says you were a bully...(laughing) A bully? Moi?That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.I don't know.Doesn't sound like me.Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.Says you were constantly calling me a slob.(considering) I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.We should have sex. It's old hat for us. You know my body like the back of your hand. Every curve, every freckle., You're so beautiful., May I help you?I work here. I used to work here. Stan. Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean out my desk., (into phone) Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes sir., She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.Jesus., I know you don't like me much, Stan, but please talk to Mary. She of all people should know this is a dangerous thing she's doing., This is why people must never be told. It's like waking a --This never should've happened, ma'am. We'll take care of it., Hi, it's Joel.Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.God, I can't believe I ever hated you.You must have been crazy.Guess what I'm wearing.I don't know. Panties and --Your dried cum.Jesus.You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."I can't stop thinking about you.Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.What old mill? Is that somewhere we --, I just wanted to say that. Come by my house., (small) I don't want to hurt people., Oh.Hi.What do you want, Stan?Can I... I brought some -- What's this?Nothing.I know what it is.Then why did you ask me?I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.Mary, people come to him voluntarily.I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.(hysterically) Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!Mary... please. This is hurting people., I was by myself in the park because my friend Davia was sick that day. I was on a swing. There was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog -- The man said something like, "He's friendly --" "-- he won't bite.", He won't bite. You can pet him if you want... Do you want to give him a biscuit? They're in my car. Why don't you --, Excuse me? Hello?, He took me to his car and ..., Yes, please have a seat. The doctor will be with you momentarily. Howard, your 10:30., May I help you?I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak. My name is Helene Kernfeld., I...I... I... find you physically repulsive! I can't even look at you!, I think the doctor is free this morning. He can probably take you right away for an initial consultation., How are you today, Mary?Let's see... Still dying, Howard.You don't have to jump down my throat. I was trying to be nice., Well, don't try. It's unbecoming on you.I'd like to make an appointment., Hello, Ms. Kruczynski. Nice to meet you. Please have a seat.Well, I met this man, Joel, three years ago at a senior dance... We'd both been alone for so long and..., Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine Kruczynski. She'd like to talk to you., Hi, it's Joel. What's going on, Clem? Why won't you call me back? Please call me. We need to speak.THE END, 0388_0006, 0388_0000,0388_0001,0388_0002,0388_0003,0388_0004,0388_0005, 0388_0007,0388_0008, 0388_0009, 0388_0029,0388_0030,0388_0031,0388_0032,

Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... "soulmate.", This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, "The Graduate.", The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief., Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing., Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for. This is a story of boy meets girl. You should know up front, this is not a love story., I didn't know who else to call., You did the right thing. Where is he? Thomas.Rachel? What are you doing here?I'm here to help you., Drink this.What is that?, Help me how?First, put down the plate. Now come here and sit down. The key is not to panic.I think I'm gonna be sick.Vodka.(grimacing at the taste) More. Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10. 7.Don't worry about it. Start from the beginning. Tell us what happened..., We spent the whole day together., We went shopping., We had coffee., We saw a film., We bought music. 8., I thought it was a great day.And then what happened?, I think we should stop seeing each other., (to WAITRESS) Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH., Did she say why?, Just like that., Just like that?, That is such a lie!, This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal?I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy? 9.You're happy?You're not?All we do is argue!, Maybe she was just in a bad mood., A hormonal thing., (to Rachel) What do you know about PMS?More than you., Please continue., Oh my god., Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving. (mouth full) Mmm, you're so right. These are great! (INNOCENT) What? Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr---, This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months.Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.No... I'm Sid. 10.(BEAT) So I'm Nancy?!, Jesus.Come on Hansen. You'll be ok. You're the best guy I know. You'll find someone., Or that.Here., That's harsh.(BEAT) I'm gonna throw up., You know what they say...there's plenty other fish in the sea.No.Sure they do. They say that., I don't know what I'm gonna do.You're gonna be fine. 11., Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman!, I love her smile. I love her hair. I love her knees. I love how one eye is higher up on her face than the other eye. I love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid. I love how she looks in my Clash T- shirt. I love how she looks when she's sleeping. I love the sound of her laugh. I love how I hear this song every time I think of her. I love how she makes me feel. Like anything's possible. Like, I don't know...like life is worth it., I'm in love with Summer. 12.(BEAT) For real?, For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl., Oh shit., Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that. May 21st. Other Mother's Day., Nice to meet you all., Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these?Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3.(to the table) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from...Michigan.Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this., What do we know about this new girl?Who?The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office.Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell!(DISAPPOINTED) Really?Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.Maybe she was just in a hurry.And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank.Damn.I know. She's pretty hot.That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it? 16.Dunno.Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin......and really good teeth.And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?(as explanation) Women., Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already., The Smiths. I love The Smiths.Sorry?I said. I love The Smiths. You have good taste in music.(AMAZED) You like the Smiths?(SINGING) "To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die." Love it., (accidentally out loud) Oh my god., Hi.Hello.So, uh, Summer...Tom.Yeah! How's it going so far?The city or the firm?Both... Either.I'm happy. Still getting situated. How long have you worked here? 18.Oh, you know, 4, 5... years.Really? Jesus. Did you always want to write greeting cards?Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now.What is it you want to do?I studied to be an architect actually.That's so cool! What happened?Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this.And are you any good?(points to a framed card) Well I wrote that one.(READING) "Today You're a Man. Mazel Tov on your Bar Mitzvah."It's a big seller.I meant, are you any good as an architect?Oh... No. I doubt it.Well, I'd say you're a perfectly ...adequate... greeting card writer. 19.Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. "Perfectly adequate" Hansen.They used to call me "Anal Girl." (EXPLAINING) I was very neat and organized. Anyway, I should get back., Ok, well, I'll see you around., (BEAT) Of course it does.Dinner! Pause and come eat., And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.Your favorites.We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing. 20.Oh boy.What?You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one."Hey Martin., Oh shit., He met a girl.(EXCITED) Yeah?(GRIM) Yeah., When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds. Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of "true love.", Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner., Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson., I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome.Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles.And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever!, And, finally... Exhibit D: Amanda Heller., It's just... it's complicated.What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!I know it's sudden but...No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand.(BEAT) Here.What's this?Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd I've ever met, I think this should really help explain where I'm coming from. You remember how much I loved this song when you first played it for me?Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks. 24.Right. And I still like it, don't get me wrong. It's just... When I hear it now, I don't feel the same...rush.(still confused) Ok...I press the skip button.What does this have to do with--?I'd rather listen to something else., But Amanda... this is a great fucking song!, Me and Summer.Was it ever on? 25.No.So what happened?, It's off.What?No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me.Yeah well, that's not really where we live., You ready for this?, So there we are. All alone. Nine more floors to ride. Plenty of time. I figure...this is my chance. If not now when, right? Summer...Yeah?(BEAT) So how was your weekend?It was good., I gave her all sorts of chances., I think I missed something.Dude, you got problems.And some other things.Like what, she said "hey" instead of "hi" cause that totally means she's a lesbian., What shit?What the hell is wrong with you?!, You believe that shit? 26."It was good." She didn't say "It was good." She said "It was good." Emphasis on the good. She basically said "I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym." Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over.She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.Based on..."it was good?", I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything?, No thanks. 27., I think you know what I need. Toner.Oh ok, sure, no prob., Do you want to go out with me? And the Priest says, "But we're already out!"That is hilarious!, I know!, Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over. 28., This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well.No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.Come on!They won't let you back in there after last time.I wasn't that bad.Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you.(REVERENTIAL) You saved my life that day.We are not going back there. 29.This is a work thing, Tommy. It won't be like that. The whole office is going.I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.You're not listening to me.What?The whole office is going., Hi.Hey! They said you weren't coming.Ooh that's me. (into mic) Ok. I'm the new girl so no making fun of me.You were great up there, by the way.Well you can't go wrong with The Boss.Yeah?Lived there til I was 12.I named my cat after Springsteen.No kidding? What's his name? 31.Bruce.It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later.But...what if you meet someone and fall in love?(LAUGHS) Love? You seriously believe in that stuff?Of course I do.Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents.Well mine too but --Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?Well... 33.Why, what's your take on it?, You asked if I was coming?(sitting down) I hear that.(BEAT) That makes sense.Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl,, (already drunk) Goddamn that song is brilliant! What's up Hansen?Hey, did you know Tom here's from Jersey?So you got a boyfriend?Me? No.Why not?Don't really want one.Come on. I don't believe that.You don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent?(BEAT) Are you a lesbian?No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's "girlfriend." I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know?I have no idea what you're talking about.Interesting. A real romantic., (BEAT) Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.So, uh, who's singing next?You really do.It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous. 34.Totally., I don't...(can't help himself) Self-confidence! Ha!"And I'd proudly stand UP!"Oh here we go., I think it's...kind of a huge thing.(re: singing) I'd say it's your turn loverboy.Nooo. I don't sing in public.Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.Ok then. Let's drink.It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.Bartender!That's not it.What is that then?I have no idea.I used to watch it every week.Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.Pathetic.This is gonna bother me for weeks. 35., No. I'm gonna walk. I live right down that street. Or that one., (to Summer) This guy.Ok, let's get you in a cab.He'll be fine.Hey.What's up? 36.Not you. You.(QUICKLY) Ok, goodnight McKenzie!I mean... likes you, likes you. For real. Tell her Tom., (LAUGHING) Is he gonna be ok?Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --Is that true?What?You know what. Do you...like me?Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.As a friend.Right. As a friend.Just as a friend?Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why? 37.Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.Cool.Cool.Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.G'night Summer. (under his breath) Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot., Yes, Mr. Vance?, Hey!Hey Mr. Vance., Hey!Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen., (PLAYFULLY) He exaggerates!, If you heard...Heard what?Excellent. You ready to go.I'm stalking, STARVING!, You son of a bitch. Last night, karaoke night?(ANXIOUS) Shhh.The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now?I have not been...The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl?Paul, seriously...Did you bang her?No!Blow job?No!Hand job?No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed. 40.Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her...Shhh!Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I was never here. Tom, talk to you later?... Hey, If any jobs open up... 41., Oh crap.Hi, I'm Summer..Summer, wow what an unusual name. I'm sure I'd remember that if I had heard it before. Tom, how come you've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady?Hi Paul.(not sure what else to SAY)Nice to meet you., Check them out. (SARCASTIC) That is hot. I am very turned on right now.Sometimes you can be so judgmental.Huh? 42.I mean, who are you? They're happy. Just mind your own business., 9, 9.5?Too soon to say. It's all in the dismount.If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount.I can't believe them. I have like zero patience for PDA.I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home.Yeah?(BEAT) No. That would be wrong.This is fun. You're fun. 43.Thanks.I mean, I just want to say, up front, I'm not looking for anything serious. Are you cool with that?(UNCONVINCING) Sure.It freaks some guys out when I say that.(still confused) Not me.Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations.Sure.(BEAT) Wanna hold my hand under the table?, Yeah., I'll be...back in a sec. Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself. Are you calm?Hi., Oh sweet Jesus! (into CAMERA) I fucking hate Summer. I hate her crooked teeth. 45. I hate her 1950s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head. I hate that centipede-shaped scar. I hate her...stupid...big boobs. I hate the way she sleeps. I hate the way she laughs. I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG!, It's very... complex.Complex. Yes. In a way, it speaks so much by saying... so little.I feel the same way. You wanna go to the movies?(RELIEVED) God yes! 47., A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that., The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God., It just makes you feel... peaceful., No. See now, this is torture.Why?Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there.How would you change it?There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily...Show me.What?Don't talk about it. Do it.See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so..., Whatever you want., Hey Summer. Tom., You wanna --No you go first.It doesn't matter to me.(to Co-Worker) So how's it going?, (like nothing's up) Hey./ Hi., Hello?I remember!, That's it! 50., Your girl is losing it., This is not at all as easy as it looks., Ow!, That's what I love about him. (FLIRTATIOUS) This got great reviews., There's no way.Why not? 51."Octopus's Garden?" You may as well just say "Piggies?"I told you. I love Ringo.You're insane.Why?Cause nobody loves Ringo., Is that... possible?, So what's going on with you and Summer?I don't know.Is she your girlfriend?Like, are we "going steady?" Come on, guys. We're adults.Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.You've been "seeing" this girl, what, two months now?Something like that.And you haven't discussed it? 53.No! She's not... We're not like that.We've just been... hanging out.Hanging out?!Well let me ask you this then. Do you want her to be your girlfriend?, You really need to have that talk., It's not an unreasonable question. Watch. McKenzie, do you have a girlfriend?No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about you?Like what?You're so gay.Oh dude. 54., I wouldn't say that.What would you say?Normal.Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend." That stuff is very... juvenile.I don't know... Maybe.I heard her Hansen. She's not the girlfriend type. You're gonna need to discuss it.No. We're adults. It'll be fine.Have you made her a CD yet?(BEAT) Maybe., (calling back) Just don't be a pussy., You were saying?My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl "I love you."I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean.Who the hell's Sean?My boyfriend before Mark.Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.I'm 12.Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble. 55.Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?(BEAT) Something like that.Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway?Who's Lars?He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.That son of a bitch.You see what I mean? Later dude.Coach, no, wait! I need her., Hi.Hi.Are you ok?Yeah.You sure?Summer, I've gotta ask you something.Ok. Wait! Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful., "So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?" "No you should not." "Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:", "One. Exercise. The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success.", "Two. Physical and Mental relaxation. Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others.", "Three. Charity. Reach out! You are not alone in your pain." 59., "Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you know you want to. Indulge!", "Five. Travel. Take some time to see another environment. Get perspective. It's a beautiful world. It will be for you again someday.", "Six. Redecorate. Start anew." "By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on. I bet you can hardly remember his face at all.", I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me.People think it looks good.Do you?On some.I like how you dress.Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?Hey buddy --, (BEAT) Please don't.Are you with this guy?(BEAT) Hi. I'm Tom.You're serious? This guy?It's a free country. So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend?, (to Summer) Hey.Hey.How's it going?Ok.You live around here?Yeah not too far.I've never seen you here before.You're not too perceptive.Ha. That's funny. So, uh, let me buy you a drink.No thank you.Whatever.Sorry, no thank you.(to the Douche) Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?, Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt. Hey. What is it?I can't believe you.What?You were so completely uncool in there.You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles.Come on, that guy was an asshole!You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it?I don't know. He was -- 64.See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship.Whoa. What was that?Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too...What...?I told you all along what I don't want and it's... I'm tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow?, (calling to her) I just got my ass kicked! (to Onlookers) I got one good shot in., (GENUINE) Hi. 65.(COLD) Hi.What's up?Nothing.Ok. Wait, are you still mad at me?(rolling her eyes) Tom...Holy shit you are. I can't believe you!(re: copies) Are you almost done?Yeah. I'm all done. You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense., Say you're sorry.Huh?Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk.I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk.Ok. Me too.Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need -I know -Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way.I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar. I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you. 67., Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life., Have you ever had a real "boyfriend?"What?A boyfriend. "Going steady." Whatever. You know what I mean.Well... yeah.More than one?A few.Tell me about them.Oh no way.Why?Cause there's nothing to tell.Come on, I'm interested.You wanna have the relationship history conversation?Yes.You sure about that? 68.No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it.Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus.Quarterback slash homecoming king?He was a rower. Very hot.What happened to Markus?He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me.Ok. And then?Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt. That didn't really go anywhere.The Puma?Yeah, cause, you know...And that's it?The ones that lasted.What happened? Why didn't they work out?, So how long have you known Paul and Robyn?Since grade school.No way, really? That's crazy.Yeah.Well I'm glad you called. They spoke very highly of you.Great., So...uh... how's it going?Ok.You've been pretty quiet.Sorry.I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?Uh-huh.Do you want to try some -- 71.No thanks. I'm sorry. It's just... there's this girl.Oh.I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before... Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her.(DISAPPOINTED) Well maybe you should think about... someone else... who could cheer you up., I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?, A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am., Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know?, Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with., Waiter!, (BEAT) How was your weekend?(winks at him) It was good. 73., Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why.It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend.Actually she was never my girlfriend. I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them.Sure.Me? Well I grew up --So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now?I... You wanna get out of here? I know this great..., (suddenly excited) Oh! You know what we should do..., "You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped! "You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me," I'm talking about you Summer!, I just got lucky I guess. We met in elementary school. We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just... clicked.I'm just saying... I really need some ass. I'm desperate.I wouldn't say "the girl of my dreams," no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But... truth is... Robyn's better than the girl of my dreams., Love? Shit, I don't know. As long as she's cute and she's willing, right? Actually, cute is a strong word. Not atrocious., Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a break!, Good night., That's a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they? I kinda like what Nietzsche said: "There is always some madness in love, but there is also...always some reason in madness." Think about it. Pretty smart. Although, Nietzsche also said "Kill the Jews." So there's that., Hey it's me.Hello me. You having a good day?I am thank you. Listen, about tonight... I think I might just stay in and go to bed early.What? Why?I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?Well... You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right?I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?(touching his tie) Sorta.I'd rather not. Seriously, do you mind?Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do.Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow, alright?Sure.Great. Good night Tom., I've been happily married for 30 years. She's the light that guides me home., No worries., Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write?Nope. All done. What are you working on?Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. "Good job," "well done," "way to go"... I got nothing.Why don't you try... "Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card."(BEAT) Shit. That's not bad., This is good Millie. "To my wife, the love of my life. I love you." That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... "Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete." You know, spice it up a little., What else you got?, Did you try... "Merry?"Whoa/Perfect/Yes!, "...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!"Yeah. It's pretty cool., You too., (to Tom) Is this the girlfriend?, What?Summer! Well hello! We've heard so much about you! It's so good to finally meet you.You going to see the serial killer one?Yes we are.Great! Should we save you seats?Absolutely. 82., Hey! 81.(looking at Summer) Hi Mom. Mom, Martin, this is Summer.Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if "girlfriend" is the right word...Ok. We'll see you inside., Does he hug all your friends?, You really want to see this?It sounds amazing.It's, like, all stabbing and shit.Exactly.Ok.All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.Fantastic. Oh shit.Sorry about that.It's fine.You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt.Did you tell them I was your girlfriend?What?! No way... I never used that word.They seemed to think... I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?He's very...loving., You're not having any fun.You're having enough for both of us.I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.No.Come on! I wanna dance with you.Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.So you're pissed?I'm not pissed. Summer... you know I hate this shit.Then why are you here? 84.This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it.Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting.(HURT) That's real nice.Tom!, You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?Yes Hansen. Sit down.Ok.Has something happened to you recently?What do you mean?A death in the family, someone taken ill...anything like that?No.Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving.Who?My assistant. 86.(faking badly) Your...?Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind. The reason I'm asking... lately your work performance has been... a little off.I'm not following.For example, here's something you wrote last week... (reads from a card on his DESK)Mr. Vance... are you firing me?No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most... adequate writers.Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult.That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking... perhaps you could channel your energy into... this.Funerals and sympathy?, Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go., Most days of the year are entirely unremarkable. They begin and they end without creating a single lasting memory. Most days have no real impact on the course of a life. May 8th was a Saturday., Thats what we wanted to ask you.It's just...lately you've been...better. 88.You've been much much better.So maybe it's best we don't ever bring her up again.Just let sleeping dogs lie., Ok.It's about her.Leave those dogs alone Tom!, What's going on?We have news.Do I want to hear it?, You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do., There's no fucking way!Tom., It can't be. It's impossible!It is. 89., How do you know?, Jesus Christ people! Get a room!, Tom! I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok?What? Oh yeah. Great.Do you need anything?Twinkies?Sorry.I'm out of twinkies.Well let's go.Go... where? 91., It's Thursday., (BEAT) It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible! I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... "galoogoo." It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit. 95., This one says "Go for it!" This one says "Don't give up!" And this one says "You can do it!" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you., That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense? 93.We're a greeting card company., This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.Tom!(picks up a card) Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you." Oh that's nice. 94.Tom...If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it.Tom!, Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who's next. We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...(reacting to his name) Hmm?The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute?Uh...no. I really don't.You have nothing? 92.Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right.(DISAPPOINTED) Oh...k. We'll come back to you. McKenzie --You know what...?Yes Tom.Can I say something about the cat?Well sure. Go ahead."Don't give up?" "You can do it?" This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people.Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- workers --Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that! I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... (picks a card off the TABLE) Think about it.Hansen, sit down!, Tom!, There's no fucking way!Tom.How do you know?We know.And you said she was single at Christmas. 96.She was.And now she's...Yeah.So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that. (BEAT) Fuck!, Let him go., It can't be. It's impossible!It is.But... It's May! We broke up last August.I know.Now she's getting married.I'm so sorry Tom.Married?It's insane.It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?No., Hey brother. Wanna dance? Hi.You having fun? You were great this morning.Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you?Me? I'm good. I'm great.(re: Summer's engagement) I heard.Yeah.Sucks.Yup. Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day.You know, my friends... they're all in love with you.Is that right?Look.That's nice. 101.What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea.Those are guppies.Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your "true love."Are you making fun of me now?No I'm serious.I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe.Well that's not very romantic.It's the new me. Alright... go play with your friends.You'll be ok?(LYING) Sure.Tom.Hmm?I know you think she was the perfect girl for you..., Well...glad you came?Of course. Where am I exactly?When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult.Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life.Pretty big, yeah., I can't believe it either!What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for?The right girl I guess.There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick.My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here --July.What?She's means `are you a homosexual?' 99.No. Where's that coming from?, (BEAT) So why aren't you smiling?, Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight!, (actually squeezing his CHEEKS)You mean...seven months ago?We just always wondered., I can't believe that. No girlfriend? 98.Oh you'd be surprised.Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was.Oh I'm sorry. When was that?Was it a man?So how's work?, Hey.Hello?Are you still sleeping?(GROGGY) I'm getting up. What time is it?10:30. Are we still hanging out today?Ok. Sure.I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes?I might need 45., So how was last night?It was fine. Just a work thing.Where did you guys go?Some restaurant.Fun?Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night?, Pretty standard., It's playing at 5.You want to go?I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or ---I want to see it. Let's go.Ok cool.Unless you don't want to.No, I will. That's fine.Ok., Hey. Hey Sum, it's just a movie.I know. I'm sorry Tom.Is everything alright with you?Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's.Ok., It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.I've never heard of them.And it's painful. Oh look., So.So... Now what? 107.Now...I think I'm gonna call it a day.Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?I've got pasta at home.Are you hungry?I'm pretty hungry, but --Ooh!What?I've got a great idea!What?Let's get breakfast.Now?Pancakes?, Hey. (re: suit) Where you coming from?What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there?Awhile. I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here.So... I should probably say congratulations.Probably. But only if you mean it.I don't know if I do honestly.I understand.Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy.You really do?(BEAT) God no.How are you, Tom?I'm good. Ish.That's good.Yeah I quit the office.Really? That's great! What are you doing now?Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things. So who's the guy?Who, my guy?Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.Tom...No really, I don't.Ok.It's amazing to me. You're married.I know.You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!Pretty crazy, huh?(SIGHS) I'll never understand that.Tom --What's different now? How could things change so quickly?I don't know. It just happened.What happened?! That's what I don't get. 112.I... Tom...What, tell me...I woke up one day and I knew. I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you.You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.What is?Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God!Tom, don't go.I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along.I was right?What? This is funny? 113. What are you laughing at? (trying himself not to LAUGH)Tom! You're the crazy person!What are you talking about?!One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!This is funny to you?What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself "Holy shit. Tom was right." You were right about all of it. Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well. 114.Summer! I really do hope you're happy., I know., Are you here to interview?Sorry? 115.Are you interviewing? For the position?Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?Yup.Ah. My competition.It would appear.Gee, this is a little awkward.Yes it is.Well, I hope you don't get it.I hope you don't get it.So, uh...Hmm?Are you from...California?Grew up not too far from here. Atherton, near Stanford.I know Atherton. Nice area.Have I seen you before? 116.I, uh, don't know. I don't think so.Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside?I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city.If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!Yeah.You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you.(to Girl) Excuse me.Hello stranger.When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet someone.(DEFLATED) Oh. Got it... No problem.Ok.What's that?Why not?Yeah?Yeah.Great! So... I'll wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something.We'll figure it out.Ok!Nice to meet you... I'm Autumn., Tom Hansen?Yes.Come on back., It happens. You probably weren't looking., Thank you.If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That's all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence. It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew.

Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three..., Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread. You okay, babe? You seem out of it.Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want., I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna getcha! She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the nearby console. Jessica picks it up: ON SMASHED PHOTO Cal and Tracy. This is their house., It's okay, my fault., I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies.Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien?I'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart...Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed...But he's not very funny, that's all.Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. She motions off to the side.What?, The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour., Aren't you going to say anything? Nothing. Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. It's silent. Devastating. CUT BACK TO:, (THROUGH DOOR) I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see anything, I swear. BACK INSIDE ROOM Robbie lies there frozen, horrified., Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- She SCREAMS as --Close the door! BACK TO JESSICA who slams the door shut., I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a, (whispering to him) Another time, maybe. GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar., He looks like a carrot, honey. Hannah LAUGHS. Hi.Hi. Who looks like a carrot?Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.Yes you do.Yes, she does.It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.Multiple times., I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13. Hannah's mouth drops open.My life is not PG-13!It so is. You've never left LA. You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien.(ADORABLE) He's funny.Wow. She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand. Okay, time to go. Liz doesn't move.Liz!, I think your friend Hannah is sexy. Hannah LAUGHS.You didn't really just say that.Pretty sure I did.How old are you?Thirty-three next month.Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line. There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact.I don't.I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied. Multiple times.You've got to be kiddi--We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.Is that so?That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? Hannah and Liz share a look.What do you expect me to say to that?Margarita, rocks, salt., HANNAH, I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? He keeps staring straight ahead. Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay... (THEN) There's this person. No response. We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff... Silence. She closes her eyes tightly. I slept with him. Kind of. Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing. No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God. It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud. I slept with someone. I SLEPT with someone. I slept with SOMEONE. I slept with ... please stop me, please say something. No reaction. David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-maché wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater -- Finally, Cal speaks --Please stop.The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and --Okay. Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror., Okay. He stands, limps back to the car., Are you out of your mind!? He looks up at her, pleading.I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here.Okay., I'm sorry that you had to see that. She keeps staring straight ahead.I should have knocked.For the record: I think about you while I do it --Robbie!I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --Stop it!I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because...ROBBIE --I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate. She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.Shit. Jessica jumps off the couch., We're home., Listen, Robbie --, Cal!, Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home. Robbie steps INTO FRAME.Dad?Oh. I didn't know you were here.You're getting divorced?And you jumped out of a car?(TO ROBBIE) I'm sorry you found out this way.I'm sorry you jumped out of a car., Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner...Thanks.Uh-huh., Yes.A moving car, yes.Cal!, That's my girl. Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car. Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening. She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees... He's holding CASH out the window to pay her. You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford. And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer., We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together. He thinks. I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about... He trails off. Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica. (WITH ENERGY) So, I hear Stanford early admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud.Yeah.David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ! GOD DAMN HER! He calms down, slowly. Pulls up to a DRIVEWAY. Sorry about that.It's okay. Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a deep breath, adorable. Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile. You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. Cal smiles, distracted but grateful. In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a(NOT LISTENING) Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay?Uh-huh., Yes. Just... yes. Guess what?What?My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.I'm sorry to hear that., That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore. The Girl has turned back to a group of friends. I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz.wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table. Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides:, (RE: JACOB) Gay. 15., So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so... the ground is closer. Which is nice., Great! I'll let you know when they fix it., I guess the price is right.Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here. You'll fit right in. Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.I'll take it.Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine... I assume you want to get back in shape? Cal looks down, embarrassed.I guess., Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good! You really killed this quarter! Keep it up you're going to be sitting in my seat by year's end. Really great, Cal. Seriously.Who told you Tracy and I were getting a divorce?(RELIEVED) Divorce! That's it. Amy heard you crying in the bathroom. We all thought it was cancer. Thank God.I have to go buy furniture now. Cal stands, EXITS., Go for it!, Can I help you, sir?My wife is sleeping with David Jacobowitz. I need a couch.Ooh, I understand. Can I give you a word of advice, one divorced man to another? If you don't mind?Sure.Get the matching chaise, killer deal. He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.I want it in beige.I'll write you up., (TOO LOUD) Yeah, well, my wife is screwing David Jacobowitz so eat me. The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts a napkin on his drink, and stands., Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for a friend.You've been holding the seat for an hour., (TO HIMSELF) So gay., Can't help but notice that you're always surrounded by women. Multiple women. Jacob doesn't even turn. I'm getting divorced. Or, in the process. Gonna be single again. Nothing. Any advice?Yeah. Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing. He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS. A beat, then:, Sorry I'm late, I had to pick something up from Macy's.Don't worry about it, here, sit, I've been guarding this stool with my life. Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable. It's good to see you, man. I've called you a few times. It's been a rough couple of days, obviously. Nothing I could use more than my old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, we should play racquetball, when's the last time we played racquetball?Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore. Cal takes this in.I'm sorry, what?She said we had to choose between you and Tracy. I chose you. She said no. It's cologne.Are you breaking up with me?Claire's waiting in the car. Um... there's a gift receipt in there. Sorry. Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender., This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things. A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool.Jacob Palmer.CAL WEA--I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.I already have a drink.Let me buy you a drink, Cal.Okay. Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS. My wife is cheating on me with --David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. Cal takes this in. He STANDS.Sit down, Cal.Okay. Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues: As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? Cal shakes "no." Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.Yeah, okay.Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.I'm sorry, what?, Do you have anything with a worm in it? Because I'd like a gallon of that now.Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time. He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, gets up and walks away. BACK TO CAL As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender., You know what, I don't need this, You ready to go? She nods, subservient, and follows him out. Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw., JACOB, I think it was when you screwed David Jacobowitz. Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods: she also understands it. Make sure my azaleas get enough sun. Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out... And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE., Cal? Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward silence. Neither knows what to say. I just wanted to say that... Her voice cracks. She turns away. Shit. She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and complicated about the reality of it all. Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to lighten things. Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you?I'll be fine.You have trouble in reverse is all.It was two times --Three if you count my father's foot.I did that on purpose.I knew it. They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize, stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.Once I'm settled, I'll get the kids so they can see the place. He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.I think I'm have a mid-life crisis maybe. Can women have mid-life crisis?(AVOIDING ENGAGEMENT) Make sure the lawn gets enough water.In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellowYou have to fertilize once a month. Not twice a month, not once every two months. She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.We got married so young, Cal. And I'm forty-one. And that's so much older than I thought I'd be.The sprinklers turn off behind you.And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month -- like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die -- and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know?If it rains a lot, you need to shut off the automatic setting.And we haven't been us, not for a long time. And I don't know when you and I stopped being `us' but... I mean, do you? Cal finally turns and looks at her., TROY! She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly., Well, if you must know --Ding dong. They turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter.I don't need a baby-sitter.I know, Robbie. An awkward beat, then.I love you so much --, Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but... They look around his depressing, beige apartment. A pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner. There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!So... you're like, actually going to live here? Molly looks like she's going to cry.Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. Cal NODS. You okay?You? Robbie shrugs.Can I say something with a curse? One time?Yeah. Why not? Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.Love is fucked. Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.Is that so? You in love, buddy?What is she doing here?(back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --What?Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you.But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!I know, buddy. Cal musses Robbie's hair. My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying. Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy? No response, she's glued to the television.Wait, where are you going?Okay, well... Molly, last chance!? But Molly is still locked on Efron. That's my angel. Back in a few.But, Dad --Nope. The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool., Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.Don't you love us anymore? Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned. But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--, Huh?(CHANGING TOPICS) The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver.I'm, uh... I decided to take a class.That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.Jesus Christ., Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for, What am I doing?, What the hell am I doing? He walks past a CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Inside is..., Yeah, okay.Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not.He's nice., (SMILING) I'll walk you out. Before they clear...You know it! Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:, Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?, I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker.Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time. Before I go, a toast. She holds up her glass, toasting. Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge.She's gonna kick that bar's butt! All the dorks CHEER. Liz SHRUGS.Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night.Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?, You're late.No thanks. So what exactly areHow much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?I dunno. Five hundred?Three thousand.Okay.We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. Cal holds up his foot. Take them off. Cal bends down, takes one off. (CHEWING) Other one too, please? Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.What the hell!?Are you in a fraternity, Cal?Those were my favorite shoes.ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?No.Are you Steve Jobs?What?ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS?No. I'm not Steve Jobs.Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go., I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.Ha! I think I read that in GQ.You did. I wrote it.Really? Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes.Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.Your credit card please? MONTAGE - FROM STORE TO STORE We watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store. Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred. Jacob leans in toward the tailor. Take it in there... and there. One pair of quality jeans., These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? He looks up. Jacob is gone., I'm sorry! Don't leave!No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap.What's wrong with the Gap?In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal. One pair of chinos. CHING. A cash register DINGS. Four dress shirts. CHING. CHING. CHING. CHING. Cal's arms are filling. Three casual button-downs. CHING. CHING. CHING. In a dressing room shirts come flying over the wall at Cal. Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and finally, a long overcoat. Cal stands there in an overcoat and sweater.I'm very warm.You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.What does it do?(SARCASTIC) It gives you x-ray vision, Cal.Oh my God, it does. I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.Eww.BUT --, Yes, sir., ... inch off the top., And it works?Yeah, okay, that was meaner., What are you putting on?Items one, three, eleven, and fourteen.That's okay, I do. She GIGGLES. Cal calls out.Seriously? You just ask her out like that?Yes, Cal, just like that.Yep.Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.Shut up, Cal.Tiffany!You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. Cal takes this in.Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. Cal's lower lip begins to quiver., Crazy.(HORRIFIED) Jesus!Yeah, probably., Perfect.(SMITTEN) Thanks.What are you doing tonight?I don't know.Wow., I think we should get out of here., Mouth agape. That was his line!, Shut up, Cal. A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.Hi.Hi. Jacob Palmer., JACOB, Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once., Tell me about yourself. What do you do?Does it really matter?I think we should get out of here.Okay., Can I get you a drink, Amy?, Amy Johnson. Cal extends his hand., I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly. Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with?Sexually?Yes.In my entire life?No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually. Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand.One. Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.Wow, okay... wow.What? I married young. We met in high school. He smiles, remembering. Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it.Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.(a bit emotional) I miss my wife.CAL --(QUICKLY) Don't. He pulls it back.(TO HIMSELF) -- Weaver., It does to me. She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats: It does to me. She smiles. PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God, how long have I been talking? Jacob takes her hand.Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here. She thinks, then NODS.Okay., You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing., You have a second?Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so... He closes the door behind him.You've been avoiding me.No, I haven't.You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday.I ran track in high school.That must be it. He turns serious. I'm sorry about you and Cal.Thank you.I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest.No, I do --A lot. Just to clarify. I like you a lot. I had no intention of falling for a married woman. I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face. But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work. That doesn't happen to accountants. Ever. I've checked with other accountants. She smiles. So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just... I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Officially. That sounded weird. Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward., David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel... noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night... it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately. David smiles. But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage. She's losing it, wipes her eyes. You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone. (INTO PHONE) Right, okay. No, I understand. Of course, right away. She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply: "Yes." Tracy looks up, but David is gone. 46., (calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie. Seriously?Sorry. She SIGHS., It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. They walk out together. They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Robbie NODS. You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit., (SUDDENLY SWEET) Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight?, Guess I should take it down, huh?I guess.How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? Robbie hesitates. Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. She turns back to her work. After a beat:He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.Oh. Well, good. That's... really good.He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know?Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too.I know.You do?I heard you crying the other night and... I didn't know what to do. I'm thirteen years old and... can you just tell me what I'm supposed to do in that situation? I didn't want to Google it. She smiles, shakes her head.Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary. You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so sorry.I'm okay with being like you, Mom. I like you. She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay?It'll be okay, Mom.Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. Tracy RE-ENTERS.You ready to go?, So, Robbie... I hear you're quite the soccer player.So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked. You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?Um, yes I am --Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably math. And she still loves him. Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.Listen, Robbie --, (EMOTIONAL) You promise? He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever.Hey, they need you in the conference room for a sec... oh, sorry. They look up. It's David. Tracy gathers herself, stands.David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. I'll be right back, okay, honey?, Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back in order. As he takes it all in... A LIGHT pops on. Cal DIVES into a SHRUB., I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on. CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake., I think you're ready, Cal.For what?To talk to a woman, take a woman home.Oh, no. No, I'm not.You've been watching me do it for two weeks.Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?You ask if you can buy her a drink.And what if she says no?You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.When she asks me a question about myself?You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself.And what happens?They talk about themselves. A lot.And what do I do?You act really interested. You nod a lot.And at the end of the night?You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.Do I ask?No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place.Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...What, no, I'm not ready for --Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal., Can I buy you a drink, Kate?Oh. No thank you. Cal smiles, portrays confidence.I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.Really, thank you but it's okay.I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon, one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it? She smiles.Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever. The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around, uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.So... what do you do, Cal?What do you do, Kate?I asked you first.I asked you second. She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.Seriously, what do you do?Seriously, what do you do? Now it's getting a little weird.I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? Cal NODS, exaggerated.Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? He's still nodding, as if fascinated.A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...I should get back to my friends -- Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.What were you supposed to tell me?I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? Cal looks up.That's what you took away from that? She smiles, sits back down.Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here.It is?You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again.(GENUINE) I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!So... what were you `supposed' to do next?Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then:You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.(PLAYFUL) Ask me again. Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident., What can I get --, Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so... Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches., Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:, (gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.(TURNED ON) I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot.I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.More, tell me more.I'm worried you have AIDS. She stops. Only a little. She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing.What do you want to do with me?, ... it would work!You're out of your mind.What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry.It's ridiculous.And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy.Everyone loves the cherry. Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed. But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon. No one likes the grape.I like grape., Well then you can't come to my store., Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon.For God's sake, Claire.(SING-SONGY) It's about Cal.Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne like you told me to. We don't have to dance on his grave., Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift.What?Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard... As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON Jessica. Thinking., Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately.Claire, would you cut it out?It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all.Oh, c'mon! Enough., Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. Madison walks off, calls back. Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin! She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice., Madison! Madison, wait! Madison stops walking, but not texting. Hey, I had a question --Hey, Jessica, whassup?I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so...My lips are... Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly. (EXPLAINING) Seals.Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?(NODDING) Always.Lots of college guys, I've heard.Lots of them.Even rumors about a few teachers.Totally.So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school?Oh, well first off, I have a huge rack.You do, yes.So that helps.Yes, I'm sure it does.You don't have a huge rack.No, I don't unfortunately.So that's not gonna work.Nope. Madison SIGHS.Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he?Old.Like really old?Like parent old.Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.Thank you, Madison.Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong.How?Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown.Huh?Go TMZ on his ass.I'm not following you, Madis--The full gyno. Off Jessica's blank look. A crotch shot? A nip slip?Jesus, Madison!, Yeah., Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers. I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude.Robbie, get down!I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW! That does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE. Jessica pulls him off to the side. (HEATED WHISPER) What the hell are you thinking?You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it.This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously.You'll learn to love me. I promise.I won't.Just because I'm four years younger than you?BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! This stops Robbie dead in his tracks. I've been spending time with him for a while. Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal lastHe's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.Who is he?It doesn't matter.Do I know him? Is he from town?I don't know. Yes, kind of.I'll kill him if he hurts you. Jessica tries not to smile.I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. He just sits there, lost. I'll see you around, okay? She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass. Devastated. His three friends approach., (DRAMATICALLY) There she is!Oh shit. BACK TO ROBBIE as he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET J taped to his pale, hairless chest. He has recreated the famous Scarlet Letter tableau. He pulls out a piece of paper, reads it., (INTO PHONE) Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been forever. Have you been getting out at all? I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay? The kids? They're fine. Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to see her tomorrow night. Of course I miss her. You don't know how much I miss..., So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?Yeah.First time in a while.Yeah, but no biggie. Cal tosses him back the ball. Hey, what's with the moping?Nothing. It's just... there's this girl. Cal smiles.Oh yeah? You like her?I like Pringles. This girl's my soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her. And she wants someone else.But she's your soulmate?Yeah.Well you can't just give up.Why not? Mom was yours, right?I didn't give up.Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you still love her?How old ARE you?(STRONGLY) Do you still love Mom? Cal doesn't say anything. His silence speaks volumes.Weren't we talking about you?, We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy. Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back., Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.Oh God.Cal? What are you doing here?Um, yes... we've met before.We've met before? Seriously?Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.Oh, so now she's your WIFE again? HOW CONVENIENT! Kate's getting louder now.Why don't we head inside?, Wow. Cal looks up. Tracy stands there. She's dressed down, but looks amazing. Vulnerable and nervous. (FLOORED) You look great, Cal.Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...Well you look great. Really. Cal smiles.Thank you. I talked to Nanna yesterday.Me, too. She sound okay to you?She sounded like... Nanna. She worries about us. I feel like I'm about to get detention. Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit. Which teacher is this?Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. Cal smiles.He's a really weird kid, isn't he?Yeah.I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then:So, how are things with...Oh... it's not.No, I know.You seeing anyone?Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.Oh. Because you hear things, you know.Yeah, well... Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy. I miss you, T. Tracy looks up surprised. I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school... you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know? She smiles. I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. He smiles, emboldened.All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense? (THEN) I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. Tracy's eyes well up with tears.He's a very strange boy, isn't he?I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me. She LAUGHS through her tears.(looking to the sky) Really?You two know each other?, I missed you, too. Cal takes her hand, kisses it.YES, WHY DON'T WE!? She STORMS INSIDE. Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in., OKAY! ENOUGH!!! Kate stops. Cal turns to Tracy. She looks crestfallen. I can explain. Tracy rushes out of the room. Cal calls after her. She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!, Maybe your husband should tell you. Cal hesitates.We have a mutual friend.Ha!You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard. As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it. Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does.We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral bookAsshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' --, I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?, Leave me alone, Cal!, Tracy, wait!, I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you ASSHOLE!, Tracy, I love you.Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, ASSHOLE! Tracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing., (weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate. Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met... By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF. HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT! REALLY!!!???, Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.(fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.Okay, so --I can't do this now, Cal.It's a funny story, actually --I'm going home. She opens the car door.Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU! I LOVE YOU!!! Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment. Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL... He instantly trails off, realizing. MORE GASPS. (MEEKLY COMPLETING) ... the only woman I want to be with.I don't even know who you are. Tracy gets in her car and speeds off., Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? The room goes quiet. Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember? POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it? I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... More CHEESY LAUGHTER. Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it. So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues... ... if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!? CHEERS. Hannah steps back, breathless. Richard reacts. You don't have a better offer already, do you? Everyone LAUGHS.No, that's great. I just...What?No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term.No, I know...Honey? She's really laughing now., You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT. She grabs Richard's cheeks. I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five., Let's go. She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to., She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild. She scans the room, quickly, searching for...She spots him, marches straight to him. For the first time, he looks like a deer in the headlights. She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry kiss. She pulls back.Do you remember me?Yes.Do you still think I'm attractive?Yes.Do you still want to take me home?Yes. Hannah NODS, takes his hand., Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest smile. They melt. We've seen this before. SLAM! The door to the bar busts open, revealing:, What? What did she say? The women look up., And you know what she said?, Good. Let's go there., This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.Is that a compliment?I'm not sure. Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones. I like this song.I thought you would.Yes, please. Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. BringsCheers.Cheers. They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... So is this how it normally works?What?How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?Yes. That's how it normally works. Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.And then you sleep with them?Yes.So that's what happens next? We sleep together?At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. She takes a deep breath, admits:I'm very nervous.I'm getting that.I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.You're adorable. Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here!I don't think people say `bang' anymore.I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. Okay, okay, this is happening.What?I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs. It's like you're photo-shopped.Now take off yours.No way! Not with all that happening... She motions casually at his abs. So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?(AMUSED) In the bedroom is preferable. Hannah stands, a girl on a mission., My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... We PULL BACK as they continue chatting. TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another. Body language shifts. -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. -- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. CUE MUSIC as we begin a... MONTAGE. IN ONE CONTINUOUS DOLLY MOVE WE HEAD, FIRST, TO... 87., Five thousand doll-- That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah.Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:, (TIPSY) This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head.I'm glad you like it. They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? Off his look... They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself. Sorry, let's proceed. Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again. You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?(LYING) No.Oh. My. God! You totally do!(ADMITTING) I do. She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious.How much did it cost?Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.What? No! I don't want to know anything about you.C'mon, one question.Okay, fine, but then we bang.Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or pastWhat's your mom like?Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.And your father?He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... He motions at his PILLOW. Stuff like this. She motions at his abs.And time for stuff like that? He LAUGHS., staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks terrified., Wow. You know, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost uncanny. They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then... THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.I'll see you at work. He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward. INSIDE THE DOOR Robbie sneaks down the stairs. From a kneeling position, he can hear and see everything., I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I was wondering if --David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the... times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no.Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry. Jessica, this is my work-friend. He's an accountant named David. David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica. Okay, David, well everything sounds great. Spreadsheets. David smiles knowingly., Hello.So... How was dinner?It was just for work.(POINTEDLY) It's a pretty dress.Oh, thanks. Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly. So how much do I owe yo--Did you know your kids are the only ones I baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home. I mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie. Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom -- and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong -- but not a lot wait up for Dad. Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's decent.What are you talking abo--Batshit crazy. She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.Jessica? Jessica turns, explodes?I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY! She storms off., Jessica!, Kids! Ice cream! Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing. We take in the real-time TABLEAU: Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal: watching them from the outside, looking in. It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.Hello?Hi, Cal. Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea. So... I'm in the basement. I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it. Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement. I'm sorry to bother you, I just... what do I do? Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then:It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad you called. Here: I'll walk you through it.Yeah.Pull it down. She pantomimes this in the kitchen.Okay, it's down.Now, you see the red button? I wrote `push' on it?I got it.Push. Now turn that to the right and stick the match in.Oh, there it goes!Good. Now just close the door and you're good to go. Silence. The charade is over. Now what?Well, thanks, Cal. I... appreciate your help.No, anytime. Call anytime with stuff like that.Yeah. And... thanks again. Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him., NOOOOOOOOOOO! He just does it! He turns the TV off. Silence. Molly turns towards him, stares. A long, scary, beat. Then: (free at last) Thank you. Cal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch., Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her.(not looking up) High School Musical.Beyond your pay-grade, buddy. Cal looks pained. I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do... His eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on. (TO ROBBIE) Hey. Get your coat. Robbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand. Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.No!I have to --NOOOO!I'm turning it off --, Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?Sure.Well, there's a shocker. She goes back into her trance.She still won't talk to you?Not if that show's on.No, I mean, Mom.Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.What happened?, Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing something at the old house tonight and I'm in a bit of a rush so... yeah. Thanks again for the cologne. Cal takes off., Oh, hey, Cal.Bernie.So how've you --, Hello?Hey, Cal.Oh. My. God. It's alive.I'm sorry. I know I've been out of circulation.You abandoned me at my time of need.I've been a little... things have gotten a bit... I met a woman.I bet you did.No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman.(DISBELIEVING) Okay, whatever.Actually, tonight... I'm going to meet her mother.(LAUGHING) Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself?Yes, I realize that, asshole. Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car. Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her. Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?You've got my number., Thanks. Cal HANGS up, LAUGHS to himself, and gets back to work., No!!!! She jumps, but it's too late., Daddy? Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY., Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys., Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER! Okay, we're good, let's do this., Baby! What are you wearing!?Dad's here. Tracy's face drops. I have to blindfold you.(WEARY) What is this? What is he doing?, Hi, Daddy. WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.What the hell are you doing here?Hey, cutie.WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad?Daddy!!!Jacob!, Daddy!, Hey, Robbie.Hey, Nanna., Hey, Nanna.Is that Jessica? BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw., David Jacobowitz., I want to see the boyfriend!, Daddy, no!Daddy, stop! This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates. He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know.(struggling with it) I'm TRYING!He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! Robbie stops, turns.With who?(TO BERNIE) He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him., Daddy!, Cal: are you seriously doing this in front of the kids?(QUICKLY) If it goes bad I'm supposed to take Molly upstairs and put the TV on loud. Tracy SIGHS, giving up.(STILL BLINDFOLDED) Robbie, please get this off me!Are you pointing at him?Who is she pointing at!?, No, your other daughter. Huh? Just then:Wait, you two know each other?DAD!, You left your sweater in my car the other night.Who are you?Is this a bad time -- WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right hook., (PROCESSING) Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing?, Wait, what's going on?Know what?Are you pointing at me?You made him dirty pictures? Oh God. (TO CAL) You're the one? You're the one she..., Stay the hell away from my daughter., Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother!(GETTING PUMMELLED) Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head. Jessica throws herself on Cal.(pointing at Cal) With him., Cal?What the hell are you doing here?(REALIZING) Oh, God.HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER!?I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG!WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?Well, that's not going to happen.David Jacobowitz!You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob., CALNanna!(FREAKING) I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE!Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY CHILDREN!So you two, like, really know each other?No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now.Well, then I'm going to murder you.Jacob!, Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?David Jacobowitz!?, (YANKING ON BLINDFOLD), I knew it. He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him., I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S SEVENTEEN! Jacob dives in. Tries to pull Bernie off. Bernie NAILS Jacob with an UPPERCUT!, Hi, T.Can I take these off, please?Almost. Kids? (LAUNCHING IN) Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver saw Tracy Boyle for the first time, walking the halls of Woodside Middle School --Well, might as well wait for your daughter.She's right next to you, T.(STILL BLIND) Hi, Nanna.No. No. No. No.(down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!Know what?, Well, okay. That should about do it. Look, I'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay? `Cause honestly, I don't even know what to put down here.Thank you, Officer. He nods, walks to the door. Stops there., shocked., This man is a lowlife and a(under her breath) Oh, that's ironic. Cal whips around., Just... simmer down, okay? We all have arguments, but if you're gonna fight -- just do it inside. Keep it in the family, okay? Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him., I'll kill you. The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.NOW! And that's that. Robbie runs to the driveway, looks:, Don't.CAL --, I'm sorry, what? Tracy doesn't push it. Cal turns back to Hannah. You may not be able to see it, but I have. Over and over again. You are not to see him any more.Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him. Cal turns away.Well then I don't have anything else to say to you.DAD --, Let's go. Now. She NODS. Looks back at Cal.I'm so sorry --, GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!, Go home, Dad. Cal NODS, EXITS., (one last try) Cal, c'mon -- But Cal won't even look at him., (CALLING OUT) Goodbye, Nanna., AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT DIDN'T YOU, SWEETHEART!? This time it's Tracy whose face registers shock. Hannah takes Jacob's hand, pulls him away., Go big or go home, right, buddy? Robbie looks up at him, cold., (THROUGH TEARS) Goodbye, cutie. They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things., Cal, stop being unreasona--I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL!She's all yours, David. Ouch.(WOUNDED) Nice. Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie., 2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.What do you want?Can I sit?I don't know, can you?Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?(MIMICKING) `Are we going to be mature or act like children?'Okay, so like children then. Move over. Jacob SLIDES in. I'd like to talk.You still seeing my daughter?Yes.Then I have nothing to say to you.Cal. You been hanging out here a lot?Sometimes.Must be missing a lot of work.I have a lot of vacation days.Some vacation.I hate the beach... you've got a lot of nerve coming here -- Just then, the WAITRESS re-approaches. Delivers Cal's drink. They wait her out. She EXITS.You want a sip?No, she probably spit in it. Jacob NODS as Cal pushes the drink away.Your kids miss you.You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.His eighth grade graduation is next week. You coming?Of course I'm coming.Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.He's not my biggest fan right now.Oh, that's a good excuse --Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --I love her, Cal. Cal looks up. I've never been in love before. Honestly, I've never even been in `like' before. She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal. Cal looks up at Jacob. He smiles, gently.I know you. I know what you are. You are not good enough for my daughter. And you will never have my permission nor my approval. Jacob stands., Can I get you another?What time is it?2:30. In the afternoon., I'll see you at graduation. He EXITS. Once more, Cal is alone. Just as he wants it., Ah, it's okay, I deserved it.Standing there. As always, he looks perfectly put together. He takes in Cal., Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most..., (a bit monotone) Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Welcome, Class of 2011. I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller... I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was. I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out. But that's not how it works. It sounded good when I was younger, but... it's just not how it works. There's no such thing as one true love for everyo--Stop! Robbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.Dad?Hi. May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second. Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.(HEATED WHISPER) What are you doing?I don't know. What are you doing? Robbie's eyes well up with tears.I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as -- Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me. People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck. My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around. He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd. I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father. I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that. Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since..., My son's graduation speech sucks. GASPS from the crowd.Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony. He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS. THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger., It was nice of you to come.I wouldn't have missed it. Awkward.So, how are things with your dad?Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.Yeah, probably a good idea.Wait: I thought you weren't giving up.I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. Jessica smiles., Hi, Nanna.Daddy. He smiles at her, adoring., My perfect girl. He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob. I already ordered a gun. I'm not kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt. If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the face.Cal, I'm not going to --Shut up, Jacob. Jacob shuts up. Wow. I like that. Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices: Is that a new shirt?Hannah took me to the Gap. It's actually not as bad as I thought.Seriously?, It's a good plan. She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse. Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek. You take care, Robbie. Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps up next to his son., You okay, buddy?, I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty. Cal turns, Tracy has been watching.We might have to lock him up. Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech.I've been working on it for thirty years, so... She LAUGHS, then... quiet.Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal?I don't know. I'd like to try though. I know I'd like to try. She nods, thinking.Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know -- She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream. Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then: It was rocky road by the way.No! As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream was, we PULL BACK. Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company. He smiles. FADE OUT., Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. And like that... order is restored in the universe. OVER TO ROBBIE Who approaches Jessica., (RE: ENVELOPE) I am now, Dad. I am now. Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles., 0297_0002, 0297_0000,0297_0001, 0297_0004, 0297_0005, 0297_0006,0297_0007,0297_0008,0297_0009,0297_0010,0297_0011,0297_0012, 0297_0013, 0297_0014, 0297_0018, 0297_0015,0297_0017,

And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth., No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful! PAT SR. Hey., What the fuck?!, (YELLING) Stupid fucking book!, (YELLING) I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat. 16....and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"Pat, you owe us an apology., Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here., I'm gonna go run now. I'll fix it when I get back. PAT SR. Fix it now.Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.I don't wanna go to therapy.You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go., I was reading. 17. PAT SR. Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.PAT SR. (CONT'D) What are you wearing a garbage bag for?, (INTERRUPTING)) Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this? Is there a speaker here? Is, is the speaker here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay?, Is that song really playing?We have music sometimes. 18.That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?I can't.What do you mean, you can't?I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I--, That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's.... DR. PATEL You can call me Cliff, please. Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in. 19. DR. PATEL I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you. Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now. DR. PATEL You have to take medicine. No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-- DR. PATEL I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident. DR. PATEL One incident can change a lifetime. But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers. DR. PATEL What's hers? What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I, (VOICE OVER) I left work early -- which I never do, by the way, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the high school, ...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have., (VOICE OVER) I come home, what do I see? I walk in the door and I see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it, and I walk up the stairs, and all..., ...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-..., (VOICE OVER) ...-VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song, and then I look down and I see my wife's..., ...panties on the ground and then-, (VOICE OVER) ...I look up and I see her naked in the shower..., ...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-..., (VOICE OVER) ...fuck in the shower anymore. Maybe today we will." I..., ...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history..., (VOICE OVER) ...-teacher with tenure. 22., And you know what he says to me?, (VOICE OVER) "You should probably go." That's what he says to me., So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so. DR. PATEL All right. Can you talk about something that you did, before or after? Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh... DR. PATEL ...undiagnosed bipolar. Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time. 23. DR. PATEL That had to be hard. Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of.(O.S. PRELAP) Pat, you have to take your, He says you're good..., I can't, Mom. I can't.I will call them. They'll come for you.Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them? PAT SR. What's up? I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look.You've gotta take your medication. PAT SR. Why don't you just take your medication?Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'. 24. PAT SR. Why is he wearing a garbage bag?Why are you wearing a garbage bag?To sweat. PAT SR. Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no score. Come on, help turn the juju around. I don't believe in juju, Dad. PAT SR. Come on, Mister Excelsior. You wanna be positive? Be positive. Sit down. All right, all right. PAT SR. Come on. For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game., ..luck, honey.What's that in your hand? PAT SR. It's a... see? Handkerchief? PAT SR. Yeah. That's OCD. That's crazy. PAT SR. What OCD? I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me.I'm making crabby snacks and homemades., I'm the reason? I don't think so. Mom. PAT SR., Can I do..an interview for a school project on mental illness? PAT SR. No., Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?That's him.Is he the guy who's having the problem? PAT SR. People are stupid.Yeah, that's the one. PAT SR. They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying.No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run. 27., It's for a school project! PAT SR. Don't pay any attention., Pat, don't look for Nikki! PAT SR. Take your camera and get out of here! Pat! PAT SR. Patty! Patty! Don't look for Nikki!, Ms. Meckers!Oh, God! Oh, God!Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday! How are you? Hey.What are you doing here?I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.You shouldn't be here.I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want. Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.I got it. I got it. I got it.Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here?You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here.Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker?You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight? 29.I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.Get away from me! Get away!, I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are., I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?You just have to give it some time.Yes.You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out.Yes! It will be! I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining!Good luck., Ronnie! Pat.(LAUGHS) There he is! He's back!Hey.Welcome home.Thank you.Welcome back, man.Yeah, I'm out.Yeah? You're out out?Uh-huh.Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you.Thank you.I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.'Cause you think Veronica still hates you? 31.I know Veronica still hates me.That's not true.Yes, it is. Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse."I don't know yet! (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday?Sure.I'll see you next Sunday.Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?Okay., That's not true.Ronnie! What are you doing?Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm?Did you invite him?Yes.Well, can he make it?Yeah. 32.Get in here, please. I need you., (TEARFULLY) Don't talk to me like that. PAT SR. Well then, don't behave this way., I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news. PAT SR. What's that? What's the good news? Things are looking up. PAT SR. Oh, are they? You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it. PAT SR. Listen, she might be with that guy. That, the.... Oh, no way! PAT SR. She--, no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you. She doesn't want to talk to you. No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper? 33. PAT SR. Put the phone down. You gotta... Wait just a minute. What are you doing? Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad. PAT SR. Gimme the phone. Gimme the phone.Pat! PAT SR. You gotta understand me. You wanna go back? Well then, stop this! Then don't fucking do this., (VOICE OVER) I got...a call asking to..., ...check on this house. Pat Solatano? 34.Yeah.Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet. PAT SR. You hear what he just said? You have a restraining order.Yeah, Dad, I know. PAT SR. Thank you, Officer.If you need anything...my card., Since when do cops have cards?, Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. 35. DR. PATEL Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one. Let me say something, I gotta say something. DR. PATEL Okay. This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. DR. PATEL Work on a strategy, okay? Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles. DR. PATEL Which jersey? DeSean Jackson. DR. PATEL DeSean Jackson is the man. Well, that settles that., Get over here. 37., Pat! What are you doin'?I gotta go, man.Why?I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey.I feel like an idiot.Are you comfortable?Veronica's not gonna like it.Get over here.Plus you got a tie on.Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come.Really?, Hey., DeSean Jackson's in the house!You mean rookie of the year?Yeah.(TO BABY) DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?Isn't it awesome?Not for dinner.Look, he got us flowers.Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.Hey., And wine., Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.Wow! Tremendous. Tremendous.Isn't it great?Tremendous.Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.Why?Because.Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.Isn't the market down, though?It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man.Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.I'm sorry, man.Yeah.A lot of people. My uncle, too.Really?Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike. You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure...it's like....You okay?(WHISPERING) I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and--(WHISPERING) Crushed by what?(WHISPERING) Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating.Holy shit.You can't be happy all the time.Who told you you can't be happy?It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.That's not true at all.You just can't.Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that?Who?Veronica's sister. PAT AND RONNIETiffany and...Tommy?Yeah. Just Tiffany.What happened to Tommy?He died.Tommy died?Cops die.How'd he die?Please, don't bring it up.Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany., No, how did he die?You look nice. 41.Thank you.I'm not flirting with you.Oh, I didn't think you were.I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die? What about your job?I just got fired, actually.Oh, really? How? I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?, How did who die?(TO PAT) Let's go see the house., Baby, how's it going?Great, great.Come on, let's go for the tour. 42.I've, I've been planning this forever. I love our house. I love our house. I'm really excited about it.(motions to Pat) Come on., Does it really matter?Everyone having fun? We're gonna go on a tour now. We're gonna go on a tour now., It's a light. It's a...Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer....it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.(ANNOYED) It's a joke!It's a...fireplace.In the middle of the wall?, It's a computer screen., Nope., Oh, it's a television.It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the-- 43., Guess what it is.Just keep going, keep going, keep going.Don't think so hard, don't think so hard., Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.I would call Nikki.Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?, We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an iPod?Look, look, look. 44. I can play music for the baby in any room., I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one., Gimme your iPod. Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom., No. No, I don't.That's interesting. 45.Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?, Why do you have to talk about me like that?I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?Don't talk about me in the third person.Please, gimme a break.I'm right here.Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.I know. I know, I know.God, I bet it does. I'm tired. I wanna go.No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.You can drive them both home. Now.Stop talking about me in third person.You can take Tiffany home first.You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.No... ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.Oh, God.What is your problem?!Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'mYou really, you really wanna go right now?, Trazodone!, What? I'm not telling the truth?Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.Sorry, man., Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...Oh.You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.Just be nice. Just be nice., PAT, Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.(TO PAT) What meds are you on?Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped. 46.You ever take Klonopin?Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.Right?Jesus.It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone?Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?You mean me?Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?You have poor social skills. You have a problem. 47.I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.I tell the truth. But you're mean., Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.Where?...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.Really?Yeah. Pretty cool, right?, No, that's confusing. He's dead. Wait, what? What's happening? Oh, my God. Hey., This is me. Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.How what works?I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?How old are you?Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?You're married? So am I., Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?, I don't know, Mom. 50., When am I gonna get a phone? PAT SR. You'll get a phone in due time. (to Dolores) What happened?Pat!, (WHISPERING) Mom!, (WHISPERING) I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.(WHISPERING) What is it? 51., (WHISPERING) Where's my wedding video?, I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?What about in your father's study?, (shouts O.S.) Dad, not now!, Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here., He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding! Is it here? I mean....? PAT SR.It's probably in the attic., It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.Please stop yelling!I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video! 53.Pat! Pat!(SPIRALING) I looked over there! I already looked all over there!Calm down, Pat.(YELLING) I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it! Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I...Pat! Stop it!, (YELLING) No, Mom!, (YELLING) ...don't care!(YELLING) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!, (yelling and crying) I want it! It-... PAT SR., (YELLING) Pat!, (yelling and crying) It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!, (YELLING) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!, (YELLING) I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it! Mom? Mom? No, no, no, no, no!(YELLING) Stop it!Get off me, Dad!Stop hitting him! (SCREAMING) Stop hitting him! PAT SR. I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!, (CRYING) I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 56., Police! Open the door, please. Open up. Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls. People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in. How are we doing in here, huh?, Hey, sit down. PAT SR. Sit down.It's a medication problem, but he's fine now. 57.Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office., What?What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that., Jesus Christ, who's that?, There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her., Is this a bipolar episode?, Someone, help me! Help me!, She can see it by law.Hey!, You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer. 58.Look, I gotta make out a report.No, no! No!Sit down.No, no, no, listen, sir., Sit down!I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me! 59., You need to pipe down. PAT SR. Everything all right?, Who was at the door?, ...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.Who was that, Dad? PAT SR. It was that kid with the camera.Good luck. I gotta write this up., Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this! 60. PAT SR. It's okay, everything is okay. We're fine, thank you, we appreciate it. Thank you., (RUNNING) Hey!(RUNNING) What the hell?What happened to your face? 61.Weight lifting accident.That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.I like to run by myself, okay?Me too.(stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?What?Okay? I'm running here!Me too!Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?I like this road. This is my neighborhood.(SIGHS) Oh, come on, please!Calm down, crazy. Hey!What the fuck?! I'm married!So am I!What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!Where is your wife?You're crazy!I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.I'm not the big slut! (BREATHES HEAVILY) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?, Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean.... DR. PATEL He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well. Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best. DR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can. Yeah, but that's easier said than done. DR. PATEL You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior. Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? DR. PATEL No. Why? 64. DR. PATEL (SIGHS) What good are you, man? DR. PATEL Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months? DR. PATEL Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut. DR. PATEL After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut. DR. PATEL She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same? DR. PATEL Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question? DR. PATEL Yes. With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? DR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books. No, not the books. DR. PATEL You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you., Hey!How do you know when I run? 66.I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends.No, I'm not giving you a hard time.I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.(WINDED) You wanna have dinner at this diner?Pick me up at seven thirty., Happy Halloween., Hi., Thank you.I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.You look nice.Thank you.You want to share this?Why did you order Raisin Bran?Why did you order tea? 68.(CHEWING) Because you ordered Raisin Bran.I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.(CHEWING) It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?It's good. How's your restraining order?I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.And the so-called incident with the weights.Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me. 69.I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.But you would do it?I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.How did you lose your job?By...having sex with everybody in the office.Everybody?I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.We don't have to talk about it.Thanks.How many were there?Eleven.Wow.I know.I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.Okay.Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women? 70.Yes.Really?Yes.What was that like?Hot.Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants toMade me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.What? You sat on her lap?Mm-hmm.She told you what to do?Mm-hmm.Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.I don't mind it.You don't, do you.No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. 71.I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...I heard about that....it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.Wow.Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.Yeah.So I know.You do.I just gotta get a strategy, you know?Me too.We'd better get back to the letter.Yeah, let's get back to the letter.What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.Can I at least finish my tea?Wait, what?My tea. Can I finish it?Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test?I kinda got that feeling, yeah.Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well.Yeah, she said you were cool, basically."Basically"? Was I some percentage not cool?No, she said you were cool, but you know.No, I don't know.Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?Sort of like me."Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.Why? 73.Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.You think that I'm crazier than you.(SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING) Because, well, we're different, IOh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.Keep your voice down.I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband! Forget it!Shut the fuck up.You shut the fuck up!, Be right back.Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany! 74., Fuck you!, Here you go.Tea.Thanks.Raisin Bran. Milk., Slow down, Raisin Bran., It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids.(walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.(pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you?No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.There's a restraining order on this guy.I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.That's not a good thing to do.Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.You're Tommy's widow, right?Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part., Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right? Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up. Stop it. Hey, hey, hey, get off me!What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing to these kids? Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do?I'm sorry.You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? What'd I say?, She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore., (TO PAT) Take it easy. Dude, relax., Get off!, Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?Yes, you do.No, I don't.You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?What? Hey, calm down! Hey--Just leave me alone! 75.Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole! Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me!Hey, hey!(YELLING) He's harassing me!Shut up!Bro, get off of me.(YELLING)) He's harassing me!!I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I'm sorry.I took it too far., I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.I know. I know you didn't mean it.I didn't mean it at all.I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.All the time.I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.(WALKING AWAY) I know you do.You do?(DISHEARTENED) Yeah, sure., I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter? 79., Maybe we should call the FBI. PAT SR. Don't make fun. This is serious. What FBI? Come on, let's take a look. I'll show you what this is. I'm gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this. I got this, it all corresponds.Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not aYeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number. PAT SR. But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope. PAT SR.Be nice. It's game day! I'm makin' crabby snacks and homemades.Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad! PAT SR.He's very happy.I can't. PAT SR.What are you up to, Pat?Nothing, come on. 82.What's in the envelope? PAT SR. Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?, I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer. PAT SR. No, no, no., "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!", Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great!, Dolores, you are so beautiful! PAT SR.I'm happy. PAT SR. Isn't that a good thing? PAT SR. Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am. PAT SR. No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad. PAT SR. Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go. PAT SR. Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out. PAT SR., PAT SR. It's not funny, it's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for? 80., I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date.What are you doing here?I've called her, I've texted her.Do you know this guy?Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying.What's he saying?He's saying you're being rude.How am I being rude?, I still haven't heard back. We used to work together--Just get the hell out of here...I just wanted to give you my card to give to her., She's not here.Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?Go away., Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and, Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.Oh, great, a married creep.Another rude creep., Tiffany! Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?I'm her friend. We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner. 83., What do you want with her?, --it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed., And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on. Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.She just texted me!, Danny, you're out of the hospital? And you're here on game day?, Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?I can't, I can't do it. 85.What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?I can't give the letter to Nikki.Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.I know.That was the set-up.Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister.Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?I can't do it.Tiffany, what do you want me to do? 86. Think of something.There's this thing.There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.It's a dance thing, all right.It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.Would you please!I don't have a filter when I talk.Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about? 87.What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.Think about it.WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME?I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.What? Jordie?Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely? That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki? 88.It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different.How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.Wow.It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing., Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.Well, I already did do something for you, you know., TIFFANYTIFFANY, I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go., I never understand what he's saying. (LAUGHS) What a treat!, He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer.", Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here? PAT SR. Oh, yeah., Superstition, Danny. I don't know. Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?I'm just saying--(INTERRUPTING) ) Am I messed up? Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage.Nothing's wrong!You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.Shh, shh.What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.Stop breaking my balls.Oh!!!!I got you an iPod.Whoa! Is this for me? 92.Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-(HUGS RONNIE) Oh, buddy, thank you. That's so nice of you. Wow.Thirty-two gigabytes.How many songs is that?Seven thousand.(scrolling through iPod) Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers. Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.Got some Clash.Oh, "West Side Story."Yeah, "West Side Story." It makes me peaceful.Right, right, right.And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage...Metallica...Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit.You gotta get your marriage together.(WHISPERING) I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And --Ronnie, that's fucked up. 93.Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know?I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.Veronica didn't like it.I'm not doing anything!, What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?, How you doing, Pat?Jesus. PAT SR. I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming.(RE: DANNY) I'm taking him back to the hospital., When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki? A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?How you doing, Jake?So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm. 94. PAT SR. Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him. Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game. You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth.DeSean Jackson.Yeah. Did it fit?Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay? 95., Pat, you're up to something, I know., Oh, no., Veronica hates the jersey., You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves., Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?, We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it., First of all, check with the latest legal development.Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so.... PAT SR. I'm an Eagles fan. PAT SR. Well then, what's the problem? He's not goin' anywhere. Just let him finish the game, that's all. The handkerchief is working. We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven- ten. What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please! I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.Come on., I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable.(ALARMED) What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage?Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble., 96., Okay.And now you're holding the remote?And it's working. Your dad's a genius.And Danny's the good luck charm? PAT SR. Danny's from you. This is your house, so it comes down to you. You're the one.Yeah, you're the one, Pat.As my friend Danny would say 00 I got nothing but love for you, brother.That's right. That's right.People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're, We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step., I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.Wow.I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.Where do you sleep?Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.When are you gonna give it to her?What?The letter to Nikki.Probably tonight.Really? 98.Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's veryMm-hmm.-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the(INTERRUPTING) No, that's good, that's really good.I assume you're a good teacher.Yeah. I mean, I hope so.Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean? And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.You know, being of service.Yeah.To your need.Uh-huh. 99. All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room.Can we do something else besides the dance deal?Are you fucking kidding me?I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?A deal is a deal.I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.I'm not doing it.Only walk. Do it.No. That's stupid.No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.(under his breath) You're not Nikki.Don't look up until you're halfway here. 100. That's right. Not yet. Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.I don't feel anything.Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?No., Whoa! Slow down.What?Your father wanted you to have this.He wants me to have- -all this Eagles information.It's his living.Um, tell Dad thanks., Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat., What the hell are you doing?, Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.I don't give a fuck., Hey, hey!, You know damn well what it means.DANNY (CONT'D), Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though. Who's that? What the....? (laughing) What are you doing here, man?If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out.How'd you know we were here?I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here.So is the girl, that you wrote about?He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--(looks at Tiffany) She's fine.She is my friend with an "F."A capital "F."For "friend."Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?That's it?Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.You sure?I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany. Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man. (TO TIFFANY) You should move more hips. (TO PAT) Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And....Okay.Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a bit more. You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good. (HUMS) Mm, yeah.Okay, we got it, we got it. 107.Okay. Okay. Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat."Black it up"?Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea. Come get some, Pat. Come get some. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town.Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.Excelsior, Pat!Excelsior!That's my man., Hello. Pat told me about you.What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?He wrote about you, all right.What'd he say?Cool.Okay. And then this goes into something else.Can I say something? Do you mind?No.No, please.Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!Bye! 108., Did you just throw that outside?What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.Danny, this is Tiffany. (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.Yeah.Whoa, whoa, that's enough.No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter. 105.Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.Yeah.Just say it. Say it. 106., I didn't realize that. 109. PAT SR. Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in. Okay. PAT SR. Yeah? Right. PAT SR. Hmm?, PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S SHOULDER. PAT SR. Hey. Patty.PAT SR. (CONT'D) We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that., I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing. PAT SR. What is this thing you're doing?Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?, Is that true? PAT SR. I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game. Yeah. PAT SR. Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother. You want me to go to the game with Jake? PAT SR. Of course I do.Does he want me to go? PAT SR. Of course he wants you to go., It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear., He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. 110. All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game. PAT SR. Tell him why. Because he believes in you.He told you that? PAT SR. He told me, yes. Even with all his friends? PAT SR. With all his friends. He trusts you. 111. He's not embarrassed? PAT SR. No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game. PAT SR., (over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? 115., Listen, I need to ask you something. Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.Why?These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.Guess what?What?Nikki replied to your letter. (INTERRUPTING) But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go.Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?I just hope you can handle it.Thank you. What was her energy when she gave it to you?She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?Try to stay positive.I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?No. I thought you were gonna read it out loud.Okay. Sorry. "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." I think I'm done for today, okay?(follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her., Can I use your phone? PAT SR. Is it an emergency? Yeah, kind of. PAT SR. What kind of emergency? Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time. PAT SR. Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know? She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad? PAT SR. That a bad thing? No, I think, it's a good thing. Yeah. I'm solid., JAKE INTRODUCES PAT HIS GROUP OF MALE FRIENDS., So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?, Hey, how you doing?, (laughs) Yeah, from the looney bin!He's a good dude!

The Asian invasion! They're here every week!, Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage. DR. PATEL You can say that again. Those cocksuckers!Whoa, whoa, what's going on?Stay back, Pat. Stay back. Leave the fucking Indians alone. 120., You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it. You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment. 119., Hey!, Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica.Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.Stay here, stay here!I'm not gonna go anywhere.Don't get in a fight!, What, what's wrong?, Doctor Patel! Hey!

What is this?, Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. PAT SR. He was with me. We went for a run.Really? That's crazy. 125.Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation., Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. PAT SR.How do you want me to prove it? PAT SR.Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?I know who his team is.When is the game?Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.And how are the people you're competing against?They're good. Some of them are professionals., That's the parlay. DR. PATELYou gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance. DR. PATEL That's the parlay., DAD-- Dad. I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now. PAT SR. You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?! DR. PATEL Your son was trying to-- PAT SR. It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined. No, Dad! No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't! PAT SR. No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad! PAT SR. (EMOTIONAL) I'm not a loser. PAT SR. You fucking loser! You ruined everything! DR. PATEL He was defending his brother!We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!Oh, really? 123.Yes. I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. PAT SR.There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation! PAT SR.The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.Wow.The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.Oh, wow. PAT SR.Wow. How did you know all that stuff?I did my research. Thank you. PAT SR. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. 126.Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.Is that right?By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.No. 127. Against the Cowboys. That's your team isn't it, Randy?That's his team!December twenty-eight, last game of the season.Oh, my God.I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't-- 130.We suck.No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!We can't get five! PAT SR. Give `em a five. Give `em a five. 131.We can do a five.You know what? I'm not gonna be aPat, you can't quit.I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.Pat, calm down. Thank about it.See you later.Pat, no. PAT SR. Pat. 132.(WALKING OUT) I'm out. PAT SR. What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the, Unbelievable., Oh, now you like her, Dad? PAT SR.No, no, no, no, no, no, no.What? No, no, no, no.No, don't do it.

Better than you?A lot better.A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!Shake on it., Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,, Dad! PAT SR.Dolores, would you stop him?, No, Dad! Dad! 129.Jesus! PAT SR., You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you? PAT SR. (INTERRUPTING) You think that I'm why today's happened? PAT SR. I'm the reason why today happened? PAT SR. Let's talk about that. 124. PAT SR. The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.She's right, Dad.There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts., Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of NewOh Pat.Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.Oh God. PAT SR. Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team?Pat!You are not a stand up guy!, Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. PAT SR. I like it.You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay., No. No, Patrizio-- 128. PAT SR.Dad!Patrizio, don't! It's toxic! PAT SR.DAD-- Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay? PAT SR. I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing-- PAT SR.Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet! PAT SR.What? No parlay! No!If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay., Pat!, I told you not to push it. PAT SR. Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter. He cannot be a quitter. 133. (SIGHS) You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.There's only one way to get him to show. PAT SR. What's that?Oh, what's that?We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there., Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best., She won't come. She can't come.We have to tell him that she's coming. PAT SR. We have to tell him that she's going.But that's a lie!It's a white lie. 134. PAT SR. It's a white lie, what's that matter? That's no big deal. So it's a little lie. There's no other way. PAT SR. You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.No. I don't approve. You can't do it. PAT SR. Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there. PAT SR. We have to do it.Aren't you nervous to be lying?, (READING) "...but if it was me reading the signs....", Okay., Hey., Hey, what's up?

I'm serious--they'll boot you out.Actually--I think she's--yes-- Basil's sister. Wilde--Jane Wilde., First to find a drink. I'm sure the secret of the universe has something to do with sex. There you go--why don't you do your doctorate on that? The physics of love.More your field, I think.I applied for a job.Did you?Civil Service.Well, it's a back-up plan--in your case not a bad idea. Did they accept you?Unfortunately, that I'll never know. Morning of their exam,- slept in. Well, thank Christ, (LATIN) Quo est femella?I was going to ask you., That's better.Who is that guy?This party is officially deceased! Come on--I've fixed you up a ride home., Scientists! Don't worry. We don't have to stay long. Looks mortifyingly dull.(looking at Stephen) Oh. He's strange, clever, goes on Ban The Bomb marches.They gave me the 1st., Well, I hope you find your equation., Hello.Hello.Science?Arts. So what do you-?Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist.What's a cosmologist?It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists.C of E. Church of England.(SIMULTANEOUSLY) - England.So--what do cosmologists worship then?(GRINS) A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe.(AMUSED) Really? So what's the equation?That is the question.Why didn't you stay at Oxford?My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them -What's a viva?A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again.They gave you the 1st., (aside, gloomy,to STEPHEN) This is going to hospitalize me., A little challenge for you all, as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys - Something to sort--the men from the boys--the wheat from the chaff-- the mesons from the pi-mesons--the quarks from the quacks--ten questions--each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it. Shall we say, Friday 3 o'clock?, Sod off., Oh come on, get up. How many have you got?Morning, Brian.Afternoon, Stephen. Where are they? Where are you hiding them? Your answers.Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about.How many of Sciama's questions have you done?None.You liar!I was going do them later.Later? You mean you haven't even started? Stephen, are you aware you have voluntarily embarked on a PHD in physics at one of the most prestigious colleges in England?Yes.Oh, good. Thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something.(to Brian at the door) Bri-?What?Can you whip on some Wagner?, (PASSING PAPER) John, this so illegible I'm not quite sure how wrong it is--I suspect very--and Brian... Stephen, glad you could join us.Sorry.Train timetables? Stephen, these are totally unacceptable--they expired a month ago.Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident. I could only do nine., Well...I see...well thank God. Well done Stephen., (SILENTLY MOUTHS) Nine?, (exhausted, speaks one word on each stroke), Full, give me twenty - One, drive! - Two, drive! - Three, big legs! - Four, press! - Five, boom! - Hook, send! - Catch, big send! - Hold at 32! - Big legs, Brian! - Big legs! - Stay long, Brian! - Stay long Brian!!!..., Uh - my napkin just walked in. Hi.Hello.What's the probability?Reasonably low.Croquet. Do you play croquet?(INTERESTED) Um. Not recently.Sunday morning?I'm actually busy Sunday mornings., (TO BARMAN) Do you have change for the pay- phone?Sure. I'd commit that number to memory if I were you. Here you go... Sir? Are you okay?, No, no, listen, listen, pay attention. A man enters a lift, wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th. Why?, (EXHAUSTED) Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift. Hey--it's the closest I'll get to a unifying theory, leave me alone. (raising a finger) Uh!!!, He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor.Okay, I've got one. Okay, okay-- A naked girl enters a lift -, No--we give up. No idea., Oh. Of course., Stephen, come in. Sit down. Now-- we're all rather concerned--about your choice of subject. What it's going to be.I can't decide.Any ideas?Umm-- No., Come with me., This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron, where Rutherford split the atom. One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom. Next Friday. I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London, to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose. Come along if you're interested., I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast., So I gather you've never been to church?Once upon a time.Tempted to convert?, So Stephen, you've been to church with a good woman. Are you feeling holier than thou?I'll wing it. As usual.Ohh, fowl play! Fowl play., And...William Blake., (sympathetic, to JANE) Don't worry about them. They're pun mad., Yes, please.Positively saintly, thank you.(TO STEPHEN) You've never said why you don't believe in God.A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.Er - light, please.Oh! - I'm inviting Jane to be my partner for the May Ball. (SILENTLY MOUTHING) Will you?, Good heavens. Surely not!Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine. Philistine.Boooo.How plucky of you., And Jane? What are you studying?Arts. Languages, poetry. I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually.Oh? What in?(ENCOURAGED) Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula.Arts. So, what painters do you like?Well, I like--Turner...Really? Turner? To me they all look as if they've been left out in the rain.(TO JANE) Will you try my elderflower wine?Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists.(IMPRESSED) Light or dark?That's okay -, It's so nicely cocked., (TO JANE) Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane.Stop egging him on!HA! Marvelous! Very good. "The breast is yet to come!" Indeed it is! Well done., Should we dance, do you think?Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating.I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance?No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance. (SOFTLY) Do you see how the men's cuffs and shirt-fronts, how they glow more than the dresses?(smiles, expectant) Yes...Do you know why?Why?"TIDE."The washing powder?The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light.Why do you know that?(GRINS) When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little -- like that., So why...Why?Why medieval Spanish poetry?(HAPPILY) I suppose I like to time travel.And what particular time periods do you visit?The Twenties is always fun.The roaring twenties! Cheers! So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it?"Seek then/ No learning/ from Starry Men!/ Who follow with Optic Glass/ The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass."Ouch.Was it - - was it a good time for science?A smashing time actually. Spacetime was born.Spacetime...Space and Time finally got together. People always thought they were too dissimilar, couldn't possibly work out. But then along comes Einstein, the ultimate match- maker, and decided that space and time, not only had a future, but had been married all along.The perfect couple!Well that's astonishing, isn't it?(SERIOUSLY) "In the beginning was the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and darkness-- darkness was upon the face of the deep.", Would you dance with me?, So what do we know? Let me rephrase that--what do the equations tell us, finally? How about a simple diagram? A star, more than three times the size of our sun... ...ought to end its life, how? With a collapse, the gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms, and so collapsing inwards. If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse, creating a black hole - where the warping of spacetime is so great that nothing can escape... not even light. It gets... Smaller, smaller... The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? A point. A spacetime singularity... With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working. What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now!, (TO SCIAMA) I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen--Go on. If?, If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe?, If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? -- Alright -- which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... What are you doing?Winding back the clock!(LAUGHING) Is that what you're doing?That's what I'm doing., Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... (SUDDENLY SERIOUS) ...until you get -, A singularity.A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time. The universe born from a black hole exploding.(FINALLY) Keep going.Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began?Keep going. Develop the mathematics., I don't know how., What is it? What's wrong with me?, It's called motor neuron disease.What's that?It's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity such as speaking, walking--breathing-- swallowing. The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted, cut off. The result is--gradual muscle decay, a wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control voluntary movement is--lost--entirely.Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--?Improvement should not be expected. (PAUSE) I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years. There's nothing I can do for you, I'm terribly sorry.Wait! What about--what about the brain?The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change--it's just-What?, Eventually--no-one will know what they are., (TO BEDDER) Is he up yet? THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 29, I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so...Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl.Right. OK. So--see you soon, yeah?, (TO STEPHEN) She's waiting., "Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage..." So? What did they say? Your wrist. What did they say?I have a disease, Bri.(WHISPERS) Is it--venereal, Stephen?No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player.Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub.(IMPASSIVELY) I have two years to live.What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous! You were fine a couple of days ago.Will you leave me Brian?, Stephen? Hi. It's me., STEPHEN?!, Jane!Brian--have you seen Stephen?Jane, have a seat.What is it?I understand you saw him. You know he was in hospital..., Something educational?(without looking at her) Very. John is having an affair with Martha. But Martha is in love with Alan. And I think Alan is homosexual by the look of his shirts. I'm trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness.Are you close?It's some integer of zero, but I'm not there yet.STEPHEN?You just missed him. He was here earlier.Don't do this.What?Cut me off.Go.Teach me croquet.I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it..."a slough of despond."If you don't get up and play a game with me I won't come back here again. Ever., My turn., Go away.STEPHEN? Let me in. Please. Please let me in., (POWERFULLY MOVED) Yes. It is., Go away!Are you going to talk about this or not?There's nothing to say--Is that what you want?That's what I want. I haven't got time for you. So - if you care about me at all - go.I can't.I've got two years. I need to work.I can't. I think--I've fallen in love with you. I know. Strange. Inexplicable.You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion...My chances are probably -You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything.Your glasses are always dirty. There. That's better. Isn't it?, Time., ...the solutions to the Schrodinger equation must vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have...(cutting him off) Time!Time. That's your subject? Any aspect of it, in particular?, You don't realize what lies ahead. His life is going to be very short. So. Be careful. Science is against you. And it's not going to be a fight, Jane. It's going to be a very heavy defeat. For all of us., I know--I know what you all think. That I don't look a terribly strong person. But I love him. And he loves me. We're going to fight this illness--all of us., Ready. Good luck. Are you sure I can't drive you?, SCIAMACome in Stephen. How are you?(his speech has worsened) Fine.Would you like to sit down?No thankyou.Brilliant. It's brilliant Stephen. So all that remains to be said is...well done. Or should I say, well done Doctor. And extraordinary theory.Thankyou.So, what now?Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything?, Yes. It would. It would indeed., Chapter Two--not really original-- uses a lot of Roger's ideas., So. Chapters One--full of holes and lacks mathematical support.But Four? A black hole at the beginning of Time.A spacetime singularity?, Well at least you run with them. Chapter Three? Too many unanswered questions., I'm sorry., TO DOCTOR--Who?To Doctor Stephen Hawking.What's astonishing is that for Stephen and I, "work" was the worst four-letter word, the worst., (CONCERNED) Stephen?, It's okay Robert., This--is--temporary.Of course., Well, it's convenient for breakfast! Thank you.(PLAYFULLY) Excuse me, did you say something?, I said--thankyou., Go Jane.One second.JANE?Are you alright?, (breathless, stunned) I've got an idea. I've got an idea Jane!, Stephen! He's changed everything! (TO JANITOR) Black Holes aren't black! And they explode!, Kip! He's done it, Kip! He's -What is it?, Ready or not., All set? You'll do fine.(LOVINGLY) Good luck!, In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So..., (aside, to TAYLOR) He's unifying Relativity--plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. For the first time., (shakes head, to SCIAMA) Thermodynamics? Last used to describe the steam engine., (SLURRING SLIGHTLY) ...allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole. Black holes aren't black at all, but glow with heat radiation., - that if it is losing particles, then, then over time -, No,no! What he's saying is--just as a hot body loses heat--right? -Second law of thermodynamics.- that a black hole -- thanks -, - it must eventually disappear. First a star vanishes into a black hole, but then the black hole must itself--vanish. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 45, You owe me another beer., (GETTING IT) - the universe was born and how it will end., Gone! From nothing--into nothing.Bang., Crunch!, He's just told us that -, Me too., STOP! Please. My name--is Professor Khalatnikov, from Soviet Academy of Sciences. My field is evolution of the hot universe--the properties of microwave background radiation, and theory of the black holes. To be honest, I came here today expecting to hear a lot of nonsense. I go home disappointed. HE!- HAS DONE IT! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ya Ya! He has done it! (Shakes Stephen's hand.) He has done it!, I'm afraid--this is complete nonsense. It's preposterous., I-, Was it something I said?, That's kinda wonderful, actually. And it explains a great deal about men., BASTARDS! Jeez!--uhhhh!--how the hell does Jane manage?Big legs! Big legs Brian!So, tell me, this Motor Neuron Disease, does it effect, y'know...What?Everything..?Different system. Automatic., Get in the car! Get! In! The Car! Come on! Let's go see Gran and Grandad!, Isn't it marvellous? We can rent it every year!, Yes. I see. But what about all the steps, Frank?, Oh, it's nothing. The climb is absolutely worth it. You get the luggage., Oh--Rain?--Falling?--Rain Falling Down?--Shivering?--Uhhhrrrrr---, Very well, no doctors., No doctors!, Very cold..., He needs to see a doctor. This keeps happening!, (TEARFUL) Thanks., I need help. I keep--I keep looking for a way-- to make this work--but I can't find it.(forcefully, but with a(UPSET) WE'RE NOT A NORMAL FAMILY!!! We're not a normal family.(turns to ROBERT) Robert--your mother's very angry at me., Ready?Surprise! Look Daddy Look!, It's an electric wheelchair. We can take it back--if you don't like it., I don't get it. You've spent years assuming Black Holes exist--you believe Cygnus X-1 will turn out to be the first black hole we can actually observe==and yet you bet Kip Thorne that it isn't a black hole?(SLURRING) Yes, a magazine subscription.Why would you bet against yourself? A subscription to what? Nature magazine?Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win!, Penthouse?, Jane--Jane? Jane? Jane! STOP! Sit down. Sit. Now--I'd like to make a suggestion-- it might sound unusual--but I've seen it work wonders. I think--you should consider -Mum--I think that is possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said.Maybe so.I used to love singing.You're very good at it.I don't know about that., Go. (pause) It's one hour a week., Oh, hello.Hello.Are you here to sing?I um--I just came to--Soprano? Soprano.I wish.Mezzo?(POINTING DOWNWARDS) Alto.Well--Just what we need. (to last departingGood question.Well, you're here now. And just in time.(SMILES) Am I?Yes. So tell me.I wouldn't call it a repertoire. Brahms--I know a little-Brahms! Wonderful. Perfect. We - Okay. Which...?Well, I have sung--"Immer leiser.", Ah! "My sleep grows evermore peaceful." Come on. Follow me. Come on. Let me hear you. Come on., (over the music) Jonathan. Jonathan Hellyer Jones.Jane. Jane Hawking.In C-sharp minor? The introduction, so lovely. From the top?Now?"Living on the edge."No, no. No, no. Just let me remember the lyrics. In English.Fabulous.Okay.Okay?(SINGS) My sleep grows ever quieter only my grief, like a veil, lies trembling over me. I often hear you in my dreams, Well, that's a long story. 'Night., Actually, no, I go for the Gospel of St. Mark.None of that wishy-washy do-gooder stuff--Matthew, Luke.Exactly. With Mark you roll up your sleeves and get stuck in. No standing on the sidelines.Well I should be going.Well met. Oh, and if your daughter would like those piano lessons.Absolutely. My husband loves music too.I could teach him as well., (TO STEPHEN) So - Stephen. Er - Jane tells me... ...you have a beautiful theorem that proves that... ...that--that the universe had a beginning?(testily, his slurring not easily understood)My new project - disproves it.Disproves it? Really? You no longer believe in the Creation?- no God? Really?No. Mine.I expect he'll cope.(TO JANE) It's the final--challenge. We'll know everything., More wine?, (to JONATHAN, ignoring, PhD thesis.What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics.Which you can set your watch by.(SMILING) Very good.If the world were all potatoes, easy--you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did, a moment of Creation. Hallelujah, God lives. But if you want to incorporate peas into the menu, which Stephen now wants to do, then it all goes -Tits up.Einstein hated peas, Quantum Theory. "God doesn't play dice with the universe", he said.Seems he not only plays dice -Seems he not only plays dice -- he throws them - where we can't find them.But physics--is back in business.Physics is back in business. Stephen thinks it a fair exchange., Water.Your...?...in physics.Oh, is that so?(ANNOYANCE SHOWING) Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No(UNDERSTANDING THIS) Yours. Your mistake?Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die.Why must God die? I don't see.The two great pillars of physicsOh, yes - Einstein....Einstein's theory.They're--different?They don't remotely play by the same rules. Peas are chaotic, and don't behave predictably at all -UNLIKE--POTATOES -Tits up. Haywire. Becomes a Godless mess.Oh, dear.- he throws them -- where we can't find them. How inconvenient!Stephen's swapped his telescopeLooking for "the world in a grain of sand."God is back on the endangered species list.The final challenge?No, thank you.(RESIGNED) We'll know everything., Wrong guy to ask. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 62, It was leukaemia. Coming up on a year ago. She fought it, I nursed her, but in the end... Music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. I've struggled with loneliness, of course. Tyranny of the empty room, all that. Music is a consolation, although my career... Well, I'm not very ambitious., Thank you for coming., No. Thank you. It was wonderful. Night then., Of course. For infinity., I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me., (NOBLY) Of course not., I have to tell you something.Is anything the matter?I'm um--I'm pregnant.Oh.Does it make a difference?, I've always supported you in your choice not to have home help, but now, you need a permanent solution. This--this current 'situation' can't go on. You need a proper live- in nurse immediately.We have help.You know what I'm talking about.(SLURRED SPEECH) Can't afford--live-in nurse.You can't afford to--For black holes--not rock concerts., I believe it's urgent., That's what you think of me? There is no way that Timothy could have any other father than Stephen. None. And for the record--I will never leave Stephen., You know very well what I'm talking about.No. I don't.We do have a right to know. We have a right to know, Jane.Know what?!Whose child Timothy is. Stephen's, or Jonathan's?, I need to go. I can't...Please don't go.Everyone's talking. It's -So. What does it matter?Well, there are other things too. I - I - just -I have feelings for you, too., Perhaps the right thing is for me to just--step back., I've just been invited -Invited? Where?Geneva.Geneva?Students can accompany me.What students?I know how much you hate -You know how much I hate -- to fly.To fly. Yes.I was thinking - that you and the- Me and the children--go on?could bring the car -- bring the car -- meet me in Bayreuth -Bayreuth? How can I manage that? On my own?Bring Jonathan.I doubt he would be willing., Jane--needs--help., CUT TO: Is--this okay?Well--I won't tell if you don't., Travel safely., And please please remember, 5 milligrams of Riluzole before and after the flight.(JAUNTY) See you - in Bayreuth., Forty-nine...Fifty. Coming ready or not!, He may not survive the journey., (IN FRENCH) He has pneumonia. He is on a life- support machine. I am not certain how long he will live. I need to know whether my staff should disconnect the ventilator?(IN ENGLISH) What are you talking about?(IN ENGLISH) If we try to bring him round from the anaesthetic it is not sure he will survive resuscitation.Stephen must live! You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic!Are you sure this is what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy, a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat. He will never speak again.There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge., Drive--safely, yes? Did you get everything in the car? His chair, equipment..., I'll step back., Stephen? This is a Spelling Board. First, you tell me what letter you want by blinking when I say the colour of the group that contains that letter. Once I know the group, you can choose the character inside that group by blinking again when I go through the colours of each letter in that group. Apparently. Okay? Let's just try. So...Green, Yellow, Blue, White, Black, Red., So then - Professor. How are you? My name is Elaine. I'm going to be your nurse, would you like that? No? Well- we'll work it out.So then..., She's here. Okay. Promise not to eat her alive..., (RAPIDLY) Red group--Yellow letter. T. Green group--Black letter. E. Green-- Green. A....T.E.A. Tea. You've memorised the board. Of course you have. What kind of tea? Blink when I say the group that has the letter you want. Green, Yellow, Blue, White, Black, Red... Yellow? Green,yellow--that's B. A tea beginning with B? Builder's tea! Right?, (CHUCKLING) I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky.Thank you.You must worship the ground beneath- wheels.And he's the perfect patient. Looking after him is so much easier than other patients I've had. And sooo funny, oh my God. When you read about him people don't tell, (cutting her off) You only do two shifts a week, Elaine., What I've done is--use components from a telephone answering system actually-- to convert the written text into synthesized speech. The voice sounds a bit robotic, but... There we go.JANE and ELAINE sit on the couch together watching - The TECHNICIAN demonstrates - builds a sentence for STEPHEN, selecting one LETTER at a time. STEPHEN is all concentration, observing how it is done.All set. Then you just click 'PLAY', like this -, (electronic voice, strong American accent), Almost there!How does it work?A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software. Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one. Using this technique, the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute.(After initial dismay) Better than one a minute.It's American! Oh, my Goodness., I think it's great!, That's all they have at the moment. Is that a problem?, Daisy. Daisy., Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn., Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..!, Time... What is the nature of Time? Will it ever come to an end? Can we go back in time? Some day these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun, or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. Only Time, whatever that may be, will tell., I will write. A Book.At four words a minute? About what? TIME., 'Course it is. That's what they all say. You don't have to be embarrassed around me, Professor. I know what men are like.Oh. I'm sorry., (SURPRISED) Professor?It is for a friend.Next one? What?, So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe. I finally found her., Elaine? Can we - ? Would you mind if I spoke with Stephen alone for a moment?We're not quite finished--can you come back in ten minutes?, (READS) "Who are we? Why are we here? If we ever learn this, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason, for then we would know the mind of God."Yes.So you're acknowledging him?HOWEVER --Did you just say something? So you're actually going to let me have this moment.You - are - welcome. E-laine has offered to travel with me to A-merica. She will look after me.(IMMENSELY HURT) Will she?Don't worry.America?(the old grin) A-nother a-ward. What can you do? Everything will be okay. How many years?They said - two. We've had so many.Be. Happy., I have loved you., Remarkable. How is he?He wants to marry her.Don't blame yourself. We're proud of you.I'm trying hard not to think of this as a failure.But it wasn't a failure.But it feels like it! It feels like it, Mum.Perhaps too many people were drawn in?(SHRUGS) He's gone back to looking for his Theory Of Everything, his single equation. Well, it'll have to explain human relationships too. It's going to have to be a wonderful piece of mathematics.All the unexpected forces... attractions... (wistful, dreamy) A attracts B --And vice versa.Of course.Then add Time - Adversity -Yes. Adversity over time --- until the situation becomes unstable, heats up.Bang!And the whole thing starts over. Whole new galaxies., Darling, I think we've cracked it. Shall we phone the Nobel committee now or shall we have another cup of tea first?, I cannot sign copies of my book-- but if you like--I could drive over it., I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came.Professor Hawking, you have said you don't believe in God... You have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you?, It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies... ...but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope., Thankyou. I first met--the Professor--was it really 1963? Time- -where does it go? Back then, he was kind of annoying. But it's been--really--one of the great joys of my life to watch this man defy every expectation, both scientific and personal. So it's with no small pride that I ask him to return to the stage once more, to continue to do what he has always done - answer your questions. My most irritating student, my esteemed colleague, my good friend--Professor Hawking. The first pre-selected question, please!, Can you hear me?I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking. He believed me.I now predict -- that I was wrong., It's from Stephen.Gosh., Your glasses are always dirty., (TO EQUERRY) I'll leave a card. There's a number you can call. They can install ramps in a day. It really would be helpful. CONGRATULATIONS--MY COMPANION--OFThank you. For today. It's been extraordinary. It's all just been rather extraordinary though, hasn't it?What are you writing?, 1082_0003,1082_0012, 1082_0001,1082_0002,1082_0005,1082_0006,1082_0007,1082_0008,1082_0009,1082_0010,1082_0011,

It was pure insanity. (reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know..., A1 We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. Revision 2., This doesn't taste like almond milk.Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --, Can I see the carton? I'll have a black coffee., Shit.Where do you think you're going?It's -- five past...You'd better be here early tomorrow., Cappuccino, please.On us., Ok., No, I insist., And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Revision 4. No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --, One second. ...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost done in here. You know what? I think we're good. Thanks for coming in., I wanted to give you an entrance.(appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos)Eh...Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.They're the worst.I don't know if they were there., I bet they were. Revision 6.Exactly. Fun.Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home?, Holy Mother of God. Ever heard of a vent?Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right?Can't. Working.What?(opening up) Yes?Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming. It'll be fun.It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.(faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest., No... No..., I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!, You gotta stop breaking into my home.You think Mom or Dad would call this a home?Please don't sit on that.Are you serious?Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.I wonder why.Don't need it.Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?That's almost insulting...When are you going to unpack these boxes?When I unpack them in my club.Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her.No. They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that?Seb --Who wants to tapas while they samba?I have someone I want you to meet.I don't want to meet anyone.You'll like her.Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?Probably not.Then what are we gonna talk about?You'll talk about the weather.Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. Revision 12.Sebastian --How long's it been?You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance.I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off.What's the difference?It's not as romantic as that.Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.I love you. Unpack your boxes.I'm changing the locks. Revision 13.(out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it., Seb.(putting on a smile) Bill. Thanks for having me back.Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision 14.Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano)I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz.There's a nice way to say that., How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me?, (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit?, ...every goddamned night.I'll stick to the set list, I promise --Too late. You're done.You're not gonna find a better player. You know that., I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --, I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia? D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights. This is my classroom. You don't like it, the door's to my left., No, Jamal. You be trippin'., (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building., There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer. CARLO TRACY, (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision 17.Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests?"I Ran"., "I Ran" it is. I walked along the avenue..., Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there.(popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set.Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies., Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight..., Ok. I remember you. And I'm sorry if I was curt that night."Curt"?Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision 18.Ok.But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far.My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"?(beat) I don't think so.Can I borrow what you're wearing?Why?Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.(irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.He doesn't tell me what to do.He just told you what to do.I let him. Revision 19. What's your name?Mia., ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded., The Prius. The one with the green ribbon., (to Sebastian) George Michael!You again.Did you just get your keys?...Yeah. Revision 20.Can you grab mine?...Which one is it?, ...Ok... Night., (almost tripping in her heels) Shit...Those look comfortable.They are...n't. Thank you for saving the day back there.You didn't give me much of a choice.Strange that we keep running into each other.It is strange. Maybe it means something.I doubt it.Yeah I don't think so either. Revision 21. Put the clicker under your chin.What?It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.Uh-huh.You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.Oh my God. Eh.Not much to look at.Agreed. I've seen better. Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon... Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car?No, that's fine... Thanks..., What?? I want a refund., Are these pastries gluten-free?No..., You're closing up Friday.I have an audition. Remember?Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.But you said --And fix your apron., ...Hi.Meetings. Studio heads. Revision 24.Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?Piece of cake. Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up?I'm off in ten.Great. I'll hide in the bathroom., That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.What's your Bogart's name...?Yeah. Greg.How long have...?We've been seeing each other for a few months. I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier.I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.Oh yeah?It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.A what?(to Sebastian) We need to wait here.How'd you get into all this? Revision 26.I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year.Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying. Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C....`Cause the world needs more lawyers.Well it doesn't need more actresses.You're not just an actress.What do you mean, "just an actress"?You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright.That is not what I said.You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you...Yeah? Revision 28.I hate jazz.What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?It means when I listen to it I don't like it.But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying "I hate animals".I do hate some animals., Do you need to be anywhere right now?, Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history. Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing., Clear the frame!, Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.Cut!, I know. They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out."Quiet on set!, Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other.I thought it was just Kenny G....What?I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29.(laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.Mia. These are things you can't unsay. It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once. That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want.Your club?...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect. The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on. So?, Hi, I just missed a call..., Ok., I got a call-back!Really? For what?That show I told you about.Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!" You've seen it, right?Obviously.What? You're the movie person.It's the one I lie about.Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.(considering this) ...Ok. Revision 31.10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?, You know what, I have to go. I love you., Hi, Mom!Hi, sweetie. How are you?Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.Oh my God! You're going to be on TV??Well -- it's not picked up yet.Not picked up?First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32.And you're in the pilot?Well, no, I have a call-back.I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week?It's another audition.I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV......Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO?Oxygen.Oxygen?, ...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision 33.Mia Dolan?, Whenever you're ready.Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --Thanks.I can do it another way --, No, thanks, that was great., Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now?, Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed. Did you forget?Shit. No. Yes. I'll change..., Mia? (with difficulty) Greg's here..., (smiles) It's ok., That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like --It's like being in a movie theater.-- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just --Probably work., It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days --Oh, sure --, Yeah, I'll have to call you back., One word for you. Nicaragua.I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision 36.Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable., Mia?, I'm sorry., I have an idea., It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.(chiming in from her bedroom) A play? You better give us roles!, (glowing) I think so., What's that? Is that a script?Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show......Is that gonna happen every time?, Nice meeting you., Sebastian?Keith? Revision 41.Holy shit. Come here, man.This is Mia. Mia, Keith.So how've you been?Great. You?Keeping busy. Got a new combo.Good for you....Looking for keys.(after a beat) I'm good.You sure? It pays.I'm good.Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long.You bet., Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision 42., It's beautiful....You're just saying that.No... I'm not.I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?That's the point.But do you think people will like it?Fuck `em.(laughs) You always say that.I truly believe it.Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.I'll be front-row.I made something for you.What's that?It could be the name design. On the door.Why does it say "Seb's"?That's what you should name it.Never.Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick".You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.Make your own history.Your play's incredible. The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision 44.I'm doing that. So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?...Which guy?The one who offered you a gig.You mean Keith? He's the worst.Why was it weird between you two?It's always weird with him.He did offer you a job.Right...Are you going to call him?No.Ok...Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick --, ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it..., I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man. If it's not your thing, just let me know. I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. But if you want it -- the job's yours., Sebastian. Didn't know if I'd see you today.(a bit awkward) Well... Here I am. Where's the piano?Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good? Sebastian?Yeah, that...that...Let's play, see how it feels. I know. It's different. But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before.You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future., Look at him -- watch -- Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed.Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. Dreams change. Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. I told you not to get me anything!Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess., Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything?, Thanks Harry, I'm good.

Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you.Nothing...You miss him.I guess. I'm adapting.(nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb.

I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.I know, but when are you done?...What do you mean?When are you done with the tour? Revision 57.But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.

What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.Do you like the music you're playing?I don't know how that matters.It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years.

So why aren't we celebrating?Why aren't you starting your club?You said yourself no one wants to go to that club!

Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.Not in my experience. Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line.(trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --This is the dream!This is not your dream.Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?Why do you care so much about being liked -- ?(finally bursting--) You're an actress, who are you to talk??

I'm sorry --Stop --I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you --It's over.(a beat; then --) ...What do you mean?I'm done embarrassing myself.You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision 65.No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. I'm gonna go home for a while....This is home., You remember the McKenzies?Oh God, I didn't see them.Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome".You look beautiful.You were great Now -- listen to me. I want you to save for a down payment. You understand? You need a home.Yes ma'am.I'm not gonna be hovering anymore....You still think New York?I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting... Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...

Revision 70.So you're happy here?I'm happier.Why won't you come?I told you.I don't buy it.(finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition!Because what?Because I'm probably not good enough.Yes you are.No. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's like you said. Maybe I need to grow up. I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore.Why?Why what?Why don't you want to do it anymore?...Because it hurts a little bit too much.I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't.How did you find me?, I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you. The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script. Revision 73....Ok.So why don't you just tell us a story?...About...?About anything. Whenever you're ready., My aunt lived in Paris for a bit...
