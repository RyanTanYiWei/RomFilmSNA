She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!So... what were you `supposed' to do next?Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised.

She holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... So is this how it normally works?What?How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?Yes. That's how it normally works. Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.And then you sleep with them?Yes.So that's what happens next? We sleep together?At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. She takes a deep breath, admits:I'm very nervous.I'm getting that.I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.You're adorable. Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here!I don't think people say `bang' anymore.I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. Okay, okay, this is happening.What?I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs. It's like you're photo-shopped.Now take off yours.No way! Not with all that happening... She motions casually at his abs.

0297,0297_088,0297_009,0297_037,"(a bit monotone) Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Welcome, Class of 2011. I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller... I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was. I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out. But that's not how it works. It sounded good when I was younger, but... it's just not how it works. There's no such thing as one true love for everyo--Stop! Robbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.Dad?Hi. May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second. Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.(HEATED WHISPER) What are you doing?I don't know. What are you doing? Robbie's eyes well up with tears.I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as -- Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me. People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck. My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around. He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd. I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father. I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that. Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since...","0297_0883,0297_0884,0297_0885,0297_0886,0297_0887,0297_0888,0297_0889,0297_0892,0297_0893"
