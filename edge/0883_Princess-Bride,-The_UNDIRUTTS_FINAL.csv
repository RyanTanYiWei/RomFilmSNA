I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.What? -- go on --Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. ""I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,"" he said.
