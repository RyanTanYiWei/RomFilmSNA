And I think he probably just tried to do his best. DR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can. Yeah, but that's easier said than done. DR. PATEL You have to do it.

PATEL After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, ""We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out."" Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut. DR. PATEL She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same? DR. PATEL Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question? DR. PATEL Yes. With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? DR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This ""crazy sad shit,"" as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books. No, not the books. DR. PATEL You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany.

Maybe we should change the subject.I don't mind it.You don't, do you.No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. 71.I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...I heard about that....it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.

Yes, that could work. I love that.Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.Can I at least finish my tea?Wait, what?My tea. Can I finish it?Wait a minute.

Sorry. ""Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki."" I think I'm done for today, okay?(follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something.
